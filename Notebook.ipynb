But given how EV Charging infrastructure is in India right now seemed risky.  Some users do claim 300 Range on EV MAX but when I checked in their App stats that seemed like far fetched claim. Glad to have chosen MG ZS though the cost was quite higher.

But you will definitely sacrifice somewhat 20-30KM.\\n\\nPerformance: Well, ECO mode is what you mostly need, Normal has a lot of power. Sports mode, save it for afterlife. the car never feels lacking power even in Eco mode. In fact, Steep office parking ramps are easily overpowered in ECO mode itself. I have done 150 Km/h in eco mode easily. Haven't tried that in SPORTS.  Hill driving is smooth. There is hill decent assist as well. Auto brakes assist not rolling backwards. Superb easy to drive.\\n\\nLooks: Car looks great from front (Minus the front grill that they have reworked out of Astor, made of flimsy plastic. you can bend it with single finger press ). I really hope MG redoes the front grill for ZS EV. The back is really ordinary. Nothing of it looks like a 28L+ car.  No Fog lamps (WTF MG), Headlights are decent (Expected more lumens).

            "[\"While sub 30L EVs choices are still quite limited now, my major choice between MG ZS and Nexon EV was, like most other buyers, range anxiety. Nexon looks decent, almost 8L cheaper lost because talking to some owners gave me worries about being less 250KM on full charge. 250 is a distance that's not bad for city drivers. But given how EV Charging infrastructure is in India right now seemed risky.  Some users do claim 300 Range on EV MAX but when I checked in their App stats that seemed like far fetched claim. Glad to have chosen MG ZS though the cost was quite higher. ARAI claim was 461KM but after crossing 2000 KM on my MG including a 1000KM long drive I can pretty much have a honest stat to provide. \\n\\nCity driving: You will easily get 320-350 depending on your driving habit.\\nHighway driving: if you drive well, utilizing cruise controls, non-aggressive accelerations, KERS braking  you can easily get 380-400. \\nHaving sunroof a little open or AC on internal circulation, you can conserve range well.   But you will definitely sacrifice somewhat 20-30KM.\\n\\nPerformance: Well, ECO mode is what you mostly need, Normal has a lot of power. Sports mode, save it for afterlife. the car never feels lacking power even in Eco mode. In fact, Steep office parking ramps are easily overpowered in ECO mode itself. I have done 150 Km/h in eco mode easily. Haven't tried that in SPORTS.  Hill driving is smooth. There is hill decent assist as well. Auto brakes assist not rolling backwards. Superb easy to drive.\\n\\nLooks: Car looks great from front (Minus the front grill that they have reworked out of Astor, made of flimsy plastic. you can bend it with single finger press ). I really hope MG redoes the front grill for ZS EV. The back is really ordinary. Nothing of it looks like a 28L+ car.  No Fog lamps (WTF MG), Headlights are decent (Expected more lumens). Panoramic Sun roof is great. Interior is pretty good, premium  and organized.\\n\\nFeatures: No complains. Although 360 camera is pretty bad quality, not very useful other than kind of guessing what's being shown, you cannot guess how far things are on the sides. Images are very very distorted.  But getting to see your wheels help.\\n\\nComfort: Expected better stabilized soft suspensions. The car has higher ground clearance, therefore every pothole shakes your whole body like some weird dance move.   Seats are comfortable premium leather. But not ventilated. Long trips make you sweat a lot. \\n\\nOverall verdict:  A great car but at a premium price. To compete with all the upcoming EVs MG needs to bring  it down to a rational level. Else very few will buy it once Govt. stops zero road tax scheme on EVs. Cause the car will easily cross 32L mark there.\", 'Having driven over 1000kms the mg zs ev excite is a fantastic car. The range is over 350km on highway. In cities, the range is between 260-320km. The suspension is on the softer side. Ground clearance is good. The performance is stellar for a sub 25L car.

No ventilated seats or rear arm rest. The car is amazing to drive.

During morning, there is hardly any traffic and can drive peacefully without much hard stops and accelerations. Evening drive is mostly traffic jams and lot of signals. I am charging the vehicle once in a week (mostly on Friday), after driving around 300-320 kms and still with 10 % SOC remaining. So thermionically consistently getting around 350kms of range. A/c is used 50% time, being colder days around.\\n\\n2.Hghway drive: Recently completed Aurangabad tours with 4 people and full A/c drive. During highway drive from Pune to Aurangabad, got range of 250 kms (charged vehicle after completing 151 kms , just after Nagar ) at around 46% SOC. While coming back, used typical state highway (as visited Paithan), range improved to 280kms .There are many good charging stations between Pune-Aurangabad highway (used EV pump and Tata Power during subject drive)\\n\\nReally enjoying my Ev max and looking forward some more long drives, in coming days .', \"Company promised 400 kms/charge, practically I am getting only 250- 260 kms after 2000 kms.. showroom promised a software update which would increase driving range.. battery needs an update or software??? didn't expect this from Tata\", 'Got car after waiting for almost 3 months. Delivery was super smooth without any issues. Dealer (Saibaba) made good arrangement including small cake cutting ceremony, to celebrate the new entity in life.\\n\\nDriving in city is super smooth. For best results, always using city mode and second level of regeneration. After two /three days of driving practice in city , now able to drive the vehicle without using brake pedal at all  (single pedal drive). Regarding driving range at full charge, started with 300 kms  for first 500 kms and now reaching to almost 360kms . Tata provided mobile App (IRA), indicate your driving behavior  and is in general hand in hand with  your car range. Good driving behavior (always getting  me 9 rating), can give range of 300 kms easily. Out of 4 charging cycle (with 7.2 kw charger), also practicing charging by 15 amp  plug (overnight- 10 t0 12 hours) , which in my opinion will help better cell balancing and battery life.', 'Firstly, I had written a review last month on TATA Nexon EV Max. For some reason the mileage seemed to fluctuate based on the driving skills and usage. Since, it was brand new, based on my driving and other criteria, it indicated a very low mileage and I overreacted and posted very negatively about the car and my sincere apologies for the same. Now, after couple of charges, it is back above the promised 400/kms on a full charge.', \"Firstly, the promised mileage was 417 kms for a full charge as per the brochure. when we took delivery it was 385, but when we charged it first time at home after humungous battle with electricians and electricity board, the mileage has dropped to 272 within a week. Tata motors has all kinds of reasons. they claim 417 km mileage they claim if one drives at 30km speed. why will i need a car if it i have to drive at 30km speed, i might as well walk! didn't expect this from the Tata's at all. just like any other company they are just there to make fools out of retail customers. please do not buy this car. it's full of false promises and deceit.\", 'Had a wonderful buying experience as rto is not applicable so it saves pretty good amount, driving experience is the next benchmark for any car. It runs very smooth that you will fall in love with driving. Looks are quite beautiful and looks more better in its new intense teak blue colour, as it is electric service and maintenance cost is very low and if there is any software update Tata will call you and do it for free. Pros are money saving car, good to drive, low cost maintenance cons are you cannot take it for a long drive as charging stations are not as many as petrol pumps apart from it range gets decreased once you put in sport mode. Apart from this no cons.', 'Buying experience is good to dealer and mostly Tata make a good Car in this price range . Driving experience is very smooth and Good pickup speed. ', 'Tata always do some challenging task and this time Tata launch this amazing car.We can compare this car with MG electric which comes with double cost compared to Tata Nexon.Charging stations is a issue right now.But Tata is setting up charging stations in future there will not be any problem.', \"The car is best with it today's specifications and the car is wonderful by looking at its colour and the looks are great.Also it suits a person with good looks and the mileage is also good.\", 'Firstly a big thumbs up to Tata who have priced the car so well. No other EV car in the market is priced as aggressive as Nexon and with the features the Nexon EV MAX provide its totally a win win to the TATA. For pros it offers best in class features such as new premium feel gear knob, auto hold feature with electric handbrake, Harman infotainment screen system, and for safety point of view it has ESP with BAC, etc and the list goes on for the pros.\\nNow cons- it is a bit small car for five passenger to sit, only four adult passenger can fit in the whole car, but in the case of children 5 passenger can easily fit in, could offer new styling design in the exterior but even the same design looks good so not more light on that part.\\nThis is my review for this car, thanks.']\n",

Suddenly got in to mess while completing 15K mark, where the car batteries gone and car stopped middle of the road and Tata eventually had to replace battery after keeping over 10 days in the workshop. After big struggle the car was serviced as the service center don't have any troubleshooting or fixing capability of a EV problem. Every time when I do follow up, the workshop people mostly waiting for either (assembly)plant instruction or an Engineer to come down from Plant to fix the car. Again at 23000 Kms, had issues with charging, where the service center staff tried their level best and even after 1 week, they were unable to do the triage.  Latest update I had from Tata services today (As I am typing this review 13Dec2022), workshop needs 3 more days to fix and still not know what was the actual problem with the car.
