Thanks to him for the expert observations and photography! \", 'Review Index: Exterior  Interior - Front  Interior - Rear  In-Car Entertainment  Battery, Range & Charging  Driving the Kona Electric  Other Points  Smaller yet Significant Things', 'Exterior  \\r\\nSince the launch of the Reva electric car in 2001, only a sparse handful of electric vehicles have made an appearance in the Indian market. However, none of them have garnered as much attention as the Hyundai Kona. Unlike all the electric cars offered in India until now, the Kona is a well-rounded and internationally established product, provides an extremely high driving range, is available to private owners and isn\\x92t ridiculously overpriced. Hyundai says that they are trying to capitalize by \\x93combining two of the fastest growing trends in the auto market - SUVs + electrification\\x94. Mind you, we\\x92d consider this a crossover rather than an SUV, but that seems to just be the nomenclature these days. Any manufacturer making inroads into the electric car market at such a nascent stage also has to do the hard work of setting up the infrastructure, as well as battling the stigmas and concerns associated with electric cars (related thread: Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head). It\\x92s not an easy or financially rewarding first move, but respect to Hyundai for being a pioneer here. Since Maruti hasn\\x92t done it yet, there\\x92s no one better than India\\x92s #2 manufacturer to kick things off. \\r\\nBeing an electric car, the Kona is more expensive than equivalent fuel-powered cars. This leaves us with two ways to look at the situation. Either we compare the Kona with other cars in the same price bracket, or we compare the Kona to equivalent sized & spec\\x92d cars, and simply write-off the price difference as an \\x93EV premium\\x94.  For example, cars like the A-Class, Beetle, Fiat 500 and the Mini Cooper are priced much higher compared to what they offer size & feature wise. But they sell anyway due to fulfilling a particular niche need (looks, design, status). The Kona will do the same, fulfilling the need of being sustainable & environmentally friendly. There are a lot of buyers who are eager to buy an electric car and don\\x92t mind paying a premium, but just haven\\x92t had an option to pick so far. There hasn\\'t been much to choose from apart from the ridiculously priced Prius, toy-car e2o, much higher-priced Camry Hybrid, etc. Hyundai says they hope to fill this niche, and predict sales of 500 units per annum for the Kona in India. \\r\\nIn the international market, Hyundai offers the Kona in two battery capacities - 39 kWh and 64 kWh. In India, Hyundai decided to offer only the 39 kWh version to keep the costs down. In the UK, the price difference between the two variants is around GBP 4,125. This would have made the 64 kWh version of the Kona Electric cost roughly Rs. 4 lakh more than the current car. The 64 kWh offers a lot more range as well as a higher power output. Would Kona customers be willing to pay that extra amount for an additional ~190 km of range, especially given the extreme scarcity of EV charging points in India? Perhaps a warm welcome for the Kona in India would have Hyundai considering bringing in the 64 kWh version in the future. \\r\\nAnother point to note is that the only variant on sale in India is actually the middle variant in the international Kona Electric line-up. Our variant is still well loaded, but we do lose out on a few top-end features like a larger 8\" AVN display, HUD, Autonomous Emergency Braking, etc. \\r\\nComing to safety, the Kona is equipped with dual front airbags, side and curtain airbags, ABS + EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, impact-sensitive door locks, tyre pressure monitoring system, seatbelt reminder (for driver + front passenger) and a high speed alert system. It also gets a burglar alarm, ESC, VSM, HAC and a reverse camera with dynamic guidelines. Being an electric vehicle, the Kona comes with a Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS) that when switched on generates a humming noise while the car is in motion. The EU mandates that all electric vehicles should be fitted with a similar device to audibly warn pedestrians and cyclists.  \\r\\nHyundai is offering a standard warranty of 3 years / unlimited km, which can be extended to 5 years / 1,40,000 km. We strongly recommend this extension, especially considering that this is Hyundai\\'s first electric car in India. Hyundai is also offering 3 years Road Side Assistance with the Kona, and a standard 8 years / 1,60,000 km warranty on the battery. \\r\\nUnlike the fuel-powered Kona that\\x92s sold aboard, the electric variant gets a sealed off grille, and this makes it stand out from all the conventional cars on the road. While many may not like this design, I did. No grille also means minimal usage of chrome, which is a plus:  \\r\\nThe rear gets a split light design with the taillights & brake lights at the top, and the indicators, reversing light & rear fog lamp below. The lower part of the bumper is also finished in black plastic cladding. Use of chrome is limited to the badges. The Kona measures 1,800 mm in width and 1,570 mm in height:  \\r\\nFrom the side, it\\'s apparent that this advertised \\'SUV\\' is clearly more like a crossover / hatchback. The cladding helps make it look more SUV-ish. However, it\\x92s evident that the main selling points of an SUV - height and ground clearance, don\\'t really feature on this car. Even the watchman at BIC expressed his concern about the ground clearance looking a little low for Indian roads. The Kona\\'s length is 4,180 mm, while the wheelbase is 2,600 mm:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets a lot of features designed to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Hyundai says that the co-efficient of drag for the vehicle is 0.29:  \\r\\nBuild quality is good but not like the European cars - there are some odd panel gaps. The paint job is very good as well, but not excellent. Look closely and you might notice the orange-peel effect:  \\r\\nSomething else that is becoming a trend nowadays is the bifurcation of the DRLs from the headlamp cluster. The 5-pod LED DRLs and indicators are placed above, while the headlights are placed below:  \\r\\nLook closely and you will find this small protrusion on the DRL cluster lens:  \\r\\nThe bright and prominent DRLs make the front end look more aggressive:  \\r\\nThe headlight cluster in the bumper gets auto-on auto-leveling bi-functional LED headlamps and cornering lamps which activate when the front wheels are turned:  \\r\\nHere\\'s a look at the headlight (white) and the cornering light (yellow) in action:  \\r\\nA closer look at the debossed \\x91+\\x92 motif on the grille. This will be difficult to keep clean. The front also has a silver-grey trim running the full width of the car below the DRLs and the bonnet line:  \\r\\nA round warning light in the Hyundai logo indicates the status of the Aux. Battery Saver+, which monitors the charging status of the 12V auxiliary battery. When the indicator is illuminated, Hyundai says that touching the high voltage electric wire (orange), connector and all electric components could cause an electric shock leading to injuries:  \\r\\nThe charging port is located behind this flap on the front grille. In case of a frontal collision, the charging port could get damaged easily. We would have preferred the charging port placed elsewhere on the vehicle. The cover for the charging port gets a logo which smartly integrates the icon of a plug, as well as the letter \\'E\\'. In order to open the charging port, put the car in P, switch the car off, and press the flap near the \\'E\\' to open it. It can only be opened when the vehicle is unlocked:  \\r\\nThe dual tone bumper gets black plastic cladding at the bottom. Also notice the wind deflector down below:  \\r\\nThe front bumper also gets active air flaps that can open and close as required:  \\r\\nThree small slits on the left side of the bumper. We were told they were for additional airflow to internal components:  \\r\\nAir vents are present on both extreme ends of the bumper:  \\r\\nThe front towing point is hidden behind this cut-out:  \\r\\nUnderbody protection has been provided at the front. Due to the position of the battery pack, the underside of the Kona is extremely flat:  \\r\\nThe bonnet has muscular bulges and creases that add to the aggressive look of the front end:  \\r\\nThe creases on the bonnet are clearly visible here:  \\r\\nORVMs are electrically adjustable and auto-folding. They unfold as soon as you approach the locked car with the key in your pocket:  \\r\\nBoth the front doors get request sensors:  \\r\\nCharacter lines on the doors and the flared rear wheel arches add to the crossover / SUV look of the Kona:  \\r\\nThe doors get plastic cladding at the bottom, as well as a silver trim highlight:  \\r\\nRear quarter-glass area is too small to make a noticeable difference:  \\r\\nC-pillars get plastic inserts and three small aero fins at the tail end:  \\r\\nBend down and you\\'ll see that the battery pack hangs down below the door sills, compromising the ground clearance:  \\r\\nIt\\x92s unclear how much underbody protection there is for the battery pack. Hopefully, our notorious Indian roads won\\x92t create any problems here:  \\r\\nBlue Drive badging on the front fender:  \\r\\nBlack plastic cladding runs along the wheel arches. 17\" inch alloy wheels are shod with 215/55 Nexen N\\'Fera SU1 tyres. The alloy wheel design is unusual and may not be to everyone\\'s tastes:  \\r\\nUpon closer investigation, you\\'ll find that the darker colored-inserts are made out of plastic. These could be to aid aerodynamic efficiency without adding much more weight:  \\r\\nThe wheel arches get these clear reflectors on both sides:  \\r\\nThe rear wheel arches also get plastic cladding, which continues toward the rear and wraps around the lower part of the tail lights too:  \\r\\nLook closely through the plastic inserts and you\\'ll find rear disc brakes:  \\r\\nSomething that Indian customers like - the Kona gets a sunroof:  \\r\\nThe crossover also gets black roof rails and a stubby antenna, which sits at the rear of the roof. A shark-fin antenna would have looked a lot more modern here:  \\r\\nTailgate gets a neatly integrated spoiler, which houses an LED HMSL. The tiny cut-out touching the glass is for the rear washer:  \\r\\nThe rear gets LED tail lamps:  \\r\\nA look at the tail lights in action:  \\r\\nA rear washer and wiper are offered:  \\r\\nNumber plate is housed in a large recessed area on the tailgate. Do note that a large chrome strip has NOT been slapped on above it:  \\r\\nReversing camera is tucked away, above the number plate with the soft-touch boot release button next to it:  \\r\\nThe only chrome bits on the tailgate are the \\'Kona\\' badging on the left...  \\r\\n...and the \\'electric\\' badging on the right:  \\r\\nDual-tone rear bumper has stylized creases on the plastic cladding, along with 4 parking sensors and a tow hook. The skid plate area below is silver:  \\r\\nThe lower tail lamp clusters are surrounded by red reflectors. In addition to the turn-signal lamp for each side, the left cluster gets a reverse lamp, while the right cluster gets a rear fog lamp. Note that the boot lid does not shut perfectly around the tail lights:  \\r\\nA look at the indicator in action:  \\r\\nThe thick battery pack can be seen clearly under the car. As mentioned before, this is a significant hindrance to ground clearance:  \\r\\nFrom the front, the Kona looks more aggressive than the i20. It has a lot more presence as well:  \\r\\nA regular fuel-powered Kona could compete in the segment just above the i20. The electric powertrain is the reason it\\x92s priced several segments higher:  \\r\\nCompared to the i20, the Kona is 195 mm longer with a 30 mm longer wheelbase. The black cladding helps in giving it more of an SUV / crossover look:  \\r\\nNext to the Venue: ', 'Interior - Front  \\r\\nThe front doors open with a 3-stage action. They feel robust, and at times require a bit too much effort to pull further open. There is no satisfying \"thud\" when you shut them either. It does not feel as well-built as some of the European cars. With the ingress being like you\\'re climbing \\x91into\\x92, rather than \\x91onto\\x92, the Kona feels more like you are entering a hatchback than an SUV. Once inside, you\\'ll find that there\\'s sufficient legroom & headroom at the front. \\r\\nThe functional and understated black & silver dashboard doesn\\x92t flaunt anything futuristic. It does a good job of transitioning consumers over to an EV without making them feel like they are out of their comfort zone. Everything feels very familiar and understandable. Apart from the distinct lack of a gear lever, and a few different metrics on the MID, there isn\\x92t anything else forcing you to acknowledge that this is an electric car. \\r\\nThe Kona comes with a double-decker centre console, offering additional storage space below. The cabin is finished in both soft-touch material and hard plastics. While the center part of the dashboard has soft-touch material, hard plastics are present above and below it. Not something that you\\x92d expect on a 25-lakh car, but like we said earlier, we have to account for the \\x91EV premium\\x92 when it comes to the Kona\\x92s pricing. \\r\\nThe Kona\\x92s air conditioner is just as powerful as any fossil fuel vehicle, and cools the cabin quickly. However, it isn\\x92t as bone-chilling as some of the other Hyundais (eg. Xcent). The blower has a very wide range of 8 speeds. The lowest level is quite peaceful and the top level is powerful but can still be equated to the max blower (typically level 4) on any other vehicle. The blower starts getting loud at level 4 and then gets really loud as you go up to 8. In a selectable \\x91driver only\\x92 mode, the air only flows out from the two rightmost vents. This saves battery power, and the setting is remembered even after you turn the car off and on, so that\\x92s convenient if you are usually driving on your own. \\r\\nLateral view of the dashboard:  \\r\\nLeather-wrapped 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel is the typical smart-looking Hyundai design. It has perfect indents for your thumbs and feels great to hold:  \\r\\nThe steering has controls for the volume, audio and telephone on the left, while cruise control and MID navigation buttons are on the right:  \\r\\nDespite having a single-speed transmission, the Kona comes with paddle shifters. The paddles come with the unique function of controlling the aggressiveness of the regenerative braking. The paddle on the left increases the intensity of regenerative braking (think of it like down-shifting), while the paddle on the right decreases the regen intensity. What\\x92s more, you can bring the car to a complete halt without pressing the brake pedal by simply pulling and holding the left paddle:  \\r\\nSteering has rake & reach adjustment. It has a huge range of travel which greatly helps in finding a good driving position:  \\r\\nThe engine start/stop button comes with blue back-lighting and a silver surround. It also gets a coloured indicator light to show which mode the ignition is in:  \\r\\nThe 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster comes with a power / charge indicator on the extreme left \\x96 which indicates the rate of power drawn or regenerative charging. The extreme right displays the battery charge level (a more exact percentage readout is available on the AVN screen). The instrument cluster also gets a MID, and the speedo display changes depending on the driving mode you select:  \\r\\nHere\\'s a look at the instrument cluster on startup:  \\r\\nThe MID gives various information including tyre pressure and power consumption. The MID also shows the odometer reading and the outside temperature. In Eco mode, it turns green and displays an ECO symbol and the remaining range:  \\r\\nThe various settings that can be changed in the MID:  \\r\\nThe MID display shows which door is open. When the bonnet, sunroof or the boot are open, they flash red. A separate verbose warning is present for when the charging flap is left open:  \\r\\nThe stalks feel solid and are great to use. The vertical silver trimline looks nice. However, the stalks have prominent flash-lines that can be felt where the two plastic pieces are joined. Wipers have five intermittent settings that snap into place with a satisfying little click. Sadly, no auto wipers. You do get auto headlamps though. Fog light is a toggle switch integrated on the RHS stalk. You just push it down, it bounces back up:  \\r\\nCircular air vents on the sides get a silver surround. All AC vents can be shut off completely by angling them all the way to the right:  \\r\\nSwitches for traction control, VESS, auto charging-cable unlock, and interior illumination adjustment. Many blank spaces stick out like a sore thumb in a car at this price point:  \\r\\nOBD port is located at the base of the fuse box. Hyundai\\x92s usual \\x91master On / Off\\' switch for the electricals has been provided too:  \\r\\nLong and slim bonnet release lever is sturdily built and easy to grab:  \\r\\nLike the dashboard, the door-pads get a black colour theme with splashes of silver. They are finished in hard plastics at the top & bottom, and soft-touch material is used in the middle:  \\r\\nDoor handles are finished in silver and they get a silver surround too:  \\r\\nThe driver\\'s and front passenger\\'s windows get one-touch up / down and anti-pinch functionality. Door mirrors are electrically foldable, with an auto setting too:  \\r\\nThe door pads can hold a 1-liter bottle, as well as other small items:  \\r\\nFront seats are draped in black leather upholstery and the seats are comfortable. The floor pan is high but it doesn\\x92t make it difficult to find the right seating position. The only thing that might be a concern is if you are a taller driver, as soon as you start moving the seat up, you are going to run out of headroom. As a 5\\x929\\x94 driver, Rehaan had 2-3 inches of headroom to spare. Side bolstering, as well as under-thigh support is good. Both the front seats are ventilated (and heated) which is a HUGE boon in our tropical conditions:  \\r\\nThe driver\\'s seat is 10-way power-adjustable. The lumbar support is fixed at the perfect height, and has a huge range for its in & out movement:  \\r\\nA look at the perforated leather upholstery. Perforated material is mandatory for the seat\\'s cooling and heating functions:  \\r\\nWhile the driver\\'s seat is power-adjustable, the front passenger seat has manual adjustment:  \\r\\nFront seatbelts are height-adjustable:  \\r\\nSporty looking pedals are well spaced out. Dead pedal provided as well:  \\r\\nORVMs are really tall & wide, providing a good view of things behind you:  \\r\\nElectrochromic IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Thick C-pillars restrict visibility though:  \\r\\nCenter fascia features a touchscreen that sticks out at the top:  \\r\\nA closer look at the split center console design:  \\r\\n7.0\" floating touchscreen head-unit has been covered in a separate post later in the review:  \\r\\nRectangular air vents get round corners and a silver border. The button for the hazard lights is placed in the center:  \\r\\nClimate control module gets a piano black insert and two circular knobs on either side for temperature and fan speed controls. The buttons related to cooling get a blue indicator light, while the ones for heating get an orange light. The beauty of an electric car is that you can run the AC whilst stuck in traffic without feeling guilty about unnecessarily spinning a huge fuel guzzling engine. Another great feature is the \\x93Driver only\\x94 option that minimizes the AC\\x92s battery drain if you\\x92re the only person in the car:  \\r\\nThe center console gets an indicator for the Qi wireless smartphone charging (the charging pad is on the right). A USB port and an AUX-in port are provided next to it:  \\r\\nThe ports are backlit in blue. Convenient:  \\r\\nTwo cupholders of different sizes are located in the center console. The one towards the rear is deeper:  \\r\\nThere\\'s no gear knob in the Kona. Instead, it gets buttons for Drive, Reverse, Park and Neutral. Only the Park button gets a texture on it, making it easier to find than the other buttons. However, it\\x92s still not something you can use easily without looking. We felt that having such a large button for neutral is unnecessary. It is rarely ever used, and Hyundai could have simplified things by making it much smaller, or even hiding it away:  \\r\\nThe letters are backlit in blue, while the currently selected mode displays an orange indicator light:  \\r\\nThe electronic parking brake switch has been placed behind the transmission buttons. The space between the transmission buttons and the parking brake is raised with a piano black insert at the front. The activation and deactivation of the handbrake can be heard inside the cabin as an electric whirring sound:  \\r\\nThe center console also houses buttons for auto hold, drive mode selector and the cooled and heated seats. Cooled front seats are one of the best features to have in India. Props to Hyundai for equipping so many of their cars with it:  \\r\\nThere\\'s a small storage compartment in front of the center armrest:  \\r\\nStorage under the center armrest. The bottom has a foam lining:  \\r\\nThe lower part of the dual-level center console houses a storage area, as well as a 12V socket and a USB port:  \\r\\nThe USB port is backlit in blue:  \\r\\nMedium-sized glovebox is neither cooled nor illuminated:  \\r\\nRoof bezel consists of a compartment for your sunglasses, map lights, and sunroof controls. You can also choose the setting for the activation of the interior lights from here:  \\r\\nFelt-lined holder for your sunglasses:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets 6 airbags including dual front airbags...  \\r\\n\\x85side airbags (please don\\'t use seat covers)\\x85   \\r\\n\\x85and curtain airbags:  \\r\\nThe sunroof is wide, but not very deep. The lower cover has to be moved manually: ', 'Interior - Rear\\r\\nThe rear doors of the Hyundai Kona open and close in a two stage action. The floor pan is very high and ingress is kind of awkward because you are stepping onto a pretty high floor whilst at the same time, trying to lower yourself down onto the seat:  \\r\\nLike the front door-pads, the rear door-pads get a black color scheme. They are finished in hard plastics at the top and the bottom, and soft-touch material is present in the middle. The rear windows do not get one-touch up / down feature:  \\r\\nDoorpad can hold a 1-liter bottle, and other small items:  \\r\\nThe rear seats are best suited for 2, not 3 passengers. Even though the rear window sills are high, the cabin is airy. The sunroof is too far forward and doesn\\'t provide any benefit for the rear passengers at all. Three headrests are provided:  \\r\\nThe rear seat upholstery gets the same perforated material, despite not having any ventilated functionality:  \\r\\nISOFIX child seat anchors have been provided on both sides:  \\r\\nWhile the rear seat certainly doesn\\x92t have the kind of legroom or headroom you\\x92d expect from an \\x91SUV\\x92, we wouldn\\x92t consider either of these deal breakers. You could also say \\x93it has more legroom than a 5-series\\x94 and \\x93more headroom than a CLA-Class\\x94. However, there certainly is one large fly in the ointment -  the noticeably high floor board (due to the battery below). It results in a knees-up sitting position resulting in a lack of under-thigh support, even for shorter passengers. It would be acceptable only for small kids. Take note that this seating position can become uncomfortable very quickly for people suffering from lower back problems. Headroom is liberal. Rehaan @ 5\\'9\", had a good 2\" of clearance, though the i20 headroom is half an inch more than the Kona. The i20 also feels roomier than the Kona, as the Kona has a dip in the roofline to accommodate the sunroof internally, and the raised double-decker centre console visually eats into the cabin space too:  \\r\\nAlthough the legroom in the Kona is good, the i20 has about 2 inches more legroom. Even though the Kona has a longer wheelbase, the rear feels slightly less roomy than in the i20:  \\r\\nYou can see how high the floor is here:  \\r\\nSliding your feet under the front seat is not something most people do, but given that there is no under thigh support, you tend to want to stretch your legs forward. And that\\x92s when you will notice that there\\x92s no space under the front seats (unless the driver\\x92s seat is towards the absolute top of its height range). With the seat in the absolute lowest position, you can\\x92t squeeze more than your toes under there. The high floor due to the battery pack below is the cause of this once again:  \\r\\nAdjustable headrests at the rear are on the harder side:  \\r\\nRear centre armrest has two cupholders:  \\r\\nThe seatbacks are not scooped out. Instead, they have a molded hard plastic cladding. The lower third is covered in an elastic net for storing loose items:  \\r\\nRear cabin lamp follows the lead of whatever the setting is for the front cabin lamp (on, door or off). It can also be turned on individually by pressing its own button:  \\r\\nThe floor hump is not tall, making it easier for the middle passenger. However, the center console reduces the legroom available:  \\r\\nQuarter glass behind the rear window is tiny, and plays a greater role in the aesthetics of the car, rather than affecting the ambiance in the cabin:  \\r\\nPull these levers in order to fold the seatback forward:  \\r\\nThe rear parcel tray is large and is recessed deeply enough to keep items in place:  \\r\\nBoot is just 332L in size. A useful net is provided:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets 60:40 split rear seats:  \\r\\nWith both seats folded down, the boot capacity increases substantially:  \\r\\nAnchor points for child seats:  \\r\\nStorage space on the right to store small items. The other side gets a boot lamp:  \\r\\nSpare tire is a 17\" 135/80 space saver with a speed limit of 80 km/h. The jack is mounted below: ', \"In-Car Entertainment\\r\\nThe Kona EV gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. Connectivity is through Bluetooth, USB and AUX. Apple CarPlay & Android Auto are also supported, with an integrated button on the steering wheel for their voice recognition functions. The presence of these two modern solutions also means that there's a lack of in-built navigation. The touchscreen serves as a display for the reversing camera as well. Due to the smaller size of the screen (mid-variant offered in India), you\\x92re left with a large plastic bezel around it, which certainly doesn't look premium. On the plus side, the touchscreen is really responsive and you get physical buttons for the most used functions. There is also a star button on the right side, which is a custom button that can be set to a particular function of your choice; like the EV info screen, Bluetooth audio, or to even turn the display on / off. \\r\\nThe stereo sound quality is the kind of stuff you see in 12-13 lakh cars. This is not a 25 lakh car audio system at all. Audio sound quality is good. But that\\x92s it. It's not special like you would expect for 25 big ones. At this price point, you want premium sound, which the Kona doesn\\x92t have. The system is rather front biased. The speakers at the front are definitely way better, with deeper richer bass. The speakers at the rear seem cheaper, feeble and less powerful in comparison. At lower volumes, the system is a bit underwhelming and the sound profile seems incomplete. It lacks punch and wholeness. Once you reach about halfway up the volume level (which is significantly loud), it starts to get fuller and more well-rounded. \\r\\nThe touchscreen is placed on top of the center console. A larger screen would have looked more premium:  \\r\\nMusic is played via 6 speakers, including one on each of the 4 doors...  \\r\\n...and a tweeter on both the front doors:  \\r\\nThe main menu gives you access to the screens for phone, media, EV amongst others:  \\r\\nSecond page of the main menu:  \\r\\nA variety of settings can be altered to suit the user's preferences:  \\r\\nAdditionally, the display can be switched off from this screen (for night driving).

We\\'ve shared some tips on maximizing battery life in the \\'Charging\\' section below.  Range \\nAs electric vehicles become more and more popular, manufacturers are soon going to be advertising their prowess in \"km\" figures, rather than \"km/l\". \\nThe ARAI-approved range for the 39.2 kWh Kona is 452 km. Being the official figure, this is the range that is being touted in all marketing material, as well as most reviews. However, let’s be clear that this is very far from the realistic range you can expect the Kona to return. For the ARAI test, the car is run at a constant speed of 40-45 km/h on a flat road and there is no wind resistance. Unrealistic. \\nIn real-world conditions, international reviews as well as a few Indian owners have reported figures ranging between 250-350 km.  \\nIn our road-test, we managed to get:• 288 km on a city + highway trip (223 km traveled + 54 km range remaining + 10 km calculated adjustment for starting at 98%).  \\n• 258 km in Mumbai city traffic + 3 hrs of AC when parked (164 km traveled + 94 km range remaining) \\nMind you, in neither of these cases were we trying to prolong the range in any way. In fact, we were pushing the car a lot harder than most people would in normal driving.Consistently getting above 250 km of range is excellent for an EV in today\\'s times.  \\nSimply put, if you’re using the Kona as a purely city car, range should not be a concern whatsoever. However, if you regularly approach 250 km/day, managing range will require some planning.  Charging \\nThe Kona can be charged with 3 different chargers:1) Fastest: DC Quick Charger (50 kW): This is a CCS Type 2 charger that can charge the car from 0-80% in a blazing fast 57 minutes. It’s big, and it’s expensive – so isn’t ideal for personal ownership. Hyundai has tied up with IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) to set up these fast charging stations in 1 fuel pump in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai each. Hopefully, a good market response to the Kona will have more of these charging stations sprouting up soon. \\n2) Normal: AC Wall Station Charger (7.2 kW): This wall-mounted charger comes free with your Kona, and would typically be set up at your parking space. It takes 6 hrs 10 mins to fully charge the car. If you charge for just 1 hour, you’ll get roughly 50 km of range. Hyundai has tied up with Allianz Worldwide to provide consultancy on the installation of the charger. They will assess the residence type, power connection and upgradation if required for the installation. Customer reports say there might be an installation charge of Rs. 3,000, not including the required wiring to the point of installation, which will be at your expense. If you wish to purchase an additional 7.2 kW charger, expect to pay roughly Rs. 80,000 for it. Hyundai dealerships that sell the Kona will also be equipped with this charger for Kona owners to stop by and use. We did not get to use this type of charger, but Kona owner & BHPian sheldon.dz says that it takes about 30-60 seconds to power on, and requires a card to be swiped to start & stop charging. Sounds inconvenient! Hope there is a way to circumvent that. \\n3) Slow: Portable Charger (2.8 kW): A portable charger is provided free with every Kona. It resides in a bag in the boot of the car. Having this with you at all times certainly provides a great safety net and adds to the peace of mind. The slow charger can be connected to any 15 Amp socket (the larger 3-pin sockets used for ACs and fridges). This one is rather slow, and takes 19 hours to fully charge the car. If you just want a 50 km bump up in range, it can get that done in less than 3 hours. This is the charger we used. No card is required, and it starts charging immediately.Additionally, in case you run out of charge on the road, Hyundai has a fleet of Konas equipped with a car-to-car power converter for charging. They are currently in four cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. Hyundai has also tied up with MapMyIndia to display EV charging stations in their app, as well as on the Hyundai website. \\nIf you want to prolong the life of your battery, you need to understand that batteries hate HEAT. Charging results in high battery temperatures. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat gets generated. Hence, we\\'d suggest you avoid fast charging when not necessary, and even reduce the charging rate for daily charging via your vehicle\\'s settings menu. In addition to that, you can set the Kona to stop charging at 80-90%, which also aids battery health. Doing these things will not only extend the lifetime of your battery, but will also minimize range-degradation as your battery ages. \\nThe lithium-ion polymer battery is placed at floor level:  \\nA look at the battery pack.

The Kona comes with the CCS Type 2 charger. The charger combines AC charging as well as DC charging. The two lower contact pins are for DC fast charging. Most manufacturers including Jaguar, Volkswagen, BMW and Ford use CCS chargers, whereas cars like the Nissan Leaf use CHAdeMO charger. All public charging stations in India are expected to support both CCS, as well as CHAdeMO:  \\nThe charger screen displays various information. SOC stands for State Of Charge:  \\nThe light around the charging port gives the status of the charging. White indicates that the charging door is open and charging is on standby, green shows that the car is charging, blinking green indicates that scheduled charging is set, blinking red indicates a charging error, while a yellow light indicates that the 12V battery is charging or that the scheduled climate control is operating:  \\nThe battery indicator shows the battery level. The button to the right of it lights up when a scheduled charge is active. Pressing the button for 3 seconds cancels the scheduled charge in case of any emergencies:  \\nOn the infotainment display inside the car, the energy information screen shows the time required to charge from your current battery level up till 100% for each type of charger. Useful!:  \\nYou can set the limit to which you want the battery to charge. This is useful when you are charging from a station where you need to pay per unit of electricity used, or if you’d like to stop the charging before the charge rate slows down for the final few percent. This limit can be set separately for AC & DC charging:  \\nYou can also schedule off-peak charging to control the exact times between which the battery charges. This is useful when electricity pricing is different depending on the time of day.

Useful if you’re concerned about the power drawn being too high for the wiring set-up where you’re plugging in, or if you want to maximize battery health by charging at a lower current:  \\nMinimum, maximum or reduced current can be chosen individually for the station & portable AC chargers: ', 'Driving the Kona Electric Acceleration & Power \\r\\nThe 39.2 kWh Kona comes with a 100 kW motor. That equates to 134 BHP of power, and torque is rated at 395 Nm. The advertised 0-100 km/h time is 9.7 seconds. To put that into perspective, it matches the Polo GT TSI. It\\x92s snappy! \\r\\nWhen Hyundai informed us that the electric car drive was at the Buddh formula 1 circuit, I thought it was a pretty bad idea. But as soon as we were out of the pits and turned the first two corners I changed my mind! This thing is fun. Hitting the second corner, powering through it, a bit of wheelspin and a touch of opposite lock; it is a surprisingly fun and well-composed car! Interestingly, the Kona felt very much at home on the track. Unlike an internal combustion car, where the engine would be screaming and running out of breath towards the end of each gear, the Kona did it without any theatricals. Just the squealing tyres. We even gave it a bit of a high-speed run down the straight and it pulled northwards of 150 km/h without making us wait too long.  \\r\\nAs much fun as it might be on track, it\\x92s on the streets that the beauty of max torque from 0 RPM really shines. What I absolutely love about an electric car in city traffic is that there is just nothing that can beat it off the line so effortlessly. Quietly, no revving up, no slipping clutch, no going high up the revs. Just a faint electric purr and you are out ahead of everyone else at the signal. If there is anyone keeping up, they are probably giving it the beans and the whole world can tell. At most, the Kona lets out an electric whirr that\\x92s noticeable if you listen closely enough. You could even say that the electric whine is kind of space age and cool. \\r\\nClosing gaps in traffic and doing quick overtakes is also seamless, thanks to the punchy nature at city speeds. In a conventional-engined car, you have to think about which gear you are in, what speed you are at and whether you need to downshift. In an electric car, the ever-present & linear torque delivery makes it so seamless. The lack of gear changes also enables a smoother experience for passengers.  Driving Modes \\r\\nThe Kona has 4 selectable driving modes. Each mode has a differently mapped throttle response, brake regen level defaults, instrument cluster display layouts, and a few ancillary changes to optimize battery utilization. \\r\\nYou can cycle through these modes by pressing the \\x91Drive Mode\\x92 button located ahead of the front edge of the driver\\x92s armrest. I didn\\x92t like where this drive mode button was placed because you have to take your eyes off the road to locate it, and then crane your elbow back to manage to reach it with your fingers. \\r\\nThe 4 drive modes available are: \\x95 Sport Mode: Needless to say, the throttle is the sharpest and most eager in this mode. The car feels peppy, with even a 25% dab of the throttle having the nose rise up as the car surges forward. That said, it\\x92s still easily usable in everyday driving. The main dial on the instrument cluster has the needle pointing to the \\x91power %\\x92 being utilized with a digital speed reading in the middle. I\\x92m not so much of a fan of this \\x96 simply because I know how far down my foot is on the throttle, and I\\x92d rather see the needle showing the speed. In Sport mode, the brake pedal also gets an extremely wooden feel to it for the first inch or two of travel, after which it regains some feel and gets a bit easier to modulate. \\r\\n\\x95 Comfort Mode: The Kona will always start in Comfort mode, unless you previously shut it down on an even more efficient mode (Eco / Eco+). The throttle still feels lively, but not over-eager. The digital instrument cluster simulates a more traditional speedo layout, with the remaining range in km conveniently displayed in the center.  \\r\\n\\x95 Eco Mode: In this mode, the throttle is less than eager, and you have the option to set a max speed limit too (90, 100, 110, 120 or 130 km/h). The logic is that the faster you are going, the more aerodynamic resistance there will be, causing you to waste precious battery power fighting it. The slower you go (less wind resistance), the more efficient your driving can be. If set, kicking down lets you break this limit for the times you need to overtake. Interestingly, in Eco mode, the instrument cluster shows you how many km of range you have gained every time you brake, thanks to the regenerative braking (more on this later). The climate control is also restrained to a more conservative profile in Eco mode. \\r\\n\\x95 Eco+ Mode: This is just like Eco mode. However, it\\x92s more extreme. Pressing the mode button cycles through only the above 3 modes and skips this Eco+ mode. To get to it, you have to long-press the mode button. For Eco+ the speed limit is fixed at a maximum of 90 km/h, and the climate control system is disabled. You\\x92d only want to use this mode if you were desperately trying to extend your battery for as many km as you could.PRND Selection \\r\\nThe Kona has a single-speed reduction transmission. You do however have to switch between Park, Neutral, Reverse and Drive using a set of 4 buttons. This isn\\x92t too difficult to get used to. However, the issue is locating and using the buttons quickly without having to look at them for reference every time. The Park button does have a textured strip at the top of it, but even then, it\\x92s still hard to confidently locate the others in a purely tactile way. We grumbled about this quite a bit, but then discovered a way to make it work. There is a raised mound behind this set of 4 buttons. If you cup that with your left palm, the buttons fall consistently at your fingertips, making them much easier to use without having to look at them. \\r\\nQuick-shifters take note that your foot has to be on the brake pedal when switching between PRND. This can sometimes catch you off-guard when doing a really quick 3-point turn, and the transmission hasn\\x92t actually shifted between Reverse and Drive despite you pressing the button. It doesn\\x92t matter if the Kona is at 0 km/h \\x96 you have to have your foot on the brake to make a successful shift.  Parking Brake \\r\\nThe Parking Brake (P) is an electronic pull / push switch located a few inches behind the PRND selector buttons. It engages and disengages the rear brakes with a soft electric whirring sound. It\\x92s important to know that the Parking Brake is more of a \\x91prevent the car from rolling or auto-creeping forward\\x92 than a safeguard against accidental acceleration. As soon as you press the accelerator, the Parking Brake will disengage! This is unlike the conventional handbrake behaviour, and can be a little dangerous \\x96 especially in a car that makes no engine noise to warn the person in the driver\\x92s seat that it is running. The Parking Brake will also disengage as soon as you switch between modes on the transmission selector (eg. go from Reverse to Drive). \\r\\nConversely, there are times when the Parking Brake automatically engages. For example, if you open the door whilst the car is in Drive \\x96 the brake will engage. This is a good safety feature to prevent the car from rolling. \\r\\nDo note that since the Parking Brake is electrically actuated, it takes about 1.5 seconds to fully engage. As a result, if you leave the brake pedal as soon as you pull the Parking Brake button, the car will surge forward slightly before the brakes fully bite. In other words, you need to keep your foot on the brake pedal for at least a second or two after pulling the Parking Brake. \\r\\nWhen the transmission is in \\x93Park\\x94 but the Parking Brake isn\\x92t engaged, the car can roll up to an inch or two forwards and backwards (eg. if someone leans on it). Remember to always park safe & use the Parking Brake.  Auto-Hold  \\r\\nBy default, the Kona starts to move forward as soon as you take your foot off the brake pedal. This is the safer default mode for a dead-silent EV, since it doesn\\x92t give the person in the driver\\x92s seat the opportunity to presume the vehicle is \\x91parked\\x92 and do some damage by accidentally hitting the accelerator. Conversely, the fact that it moves forward once you release the brake could catch people unaware too - but the behaviour is more like a conventional automatic that people are used to. \\r\\nThe alternative is turning on \\x91Auto Hold\\x92. With this activated, the Kona will hold itself in place every time it comes to a complete stop. Touching the accelerator will release the Auto Hold. This mode is much more convenient in stop & go traffic, as you do not need to keep your foot on the brake, and aren\\x92t really required to keep playing with the Parking Brake or transmission selector. \\r\\nFor the sake of safety, Auto Hold always resets to \\x91off\\x92 every time the car starts up.  Brakes \\r\\nSimilar to fossil-fuel vehicles, Electric Vehicles can brake in two ways; using the brake discs & via engine braking. However, the difference here is that when an EV brakes with engine braking, the motor is actually working as a generator and recharging the battery using the vehicle\\x92s momentum. \\r\\nAs a result, all modern EVs have regenerative braking built-in. However, brake regen adds a degree of complication to the braking procedure. The braking system has to intelligently figure out when it should be using the \\x91engine braking\\x92 and when it should be using the brake discs \\x96 most EVs do a damn good job of this. They also have to mix and smoothly transition between the two types of braking, which have their own unique deceleration characteristics and feel; and quite frankly no EV does a perfect job of it. This results in two things - brake pedal feel being artificial and braking results being non-linear. \\r\\nThe Kona is no exception. The non-linear braking behaviour makes it a little hard to modulate smoothly, especially for the first 10% of brake pedal travel \\x96 where only the regen braking is kicking in before the calipers actually grab the discs. In addition to that, in Sport mode the brake pedal becomes extremely wooden. We\\x92re not sure why this happens, but it wasn\\x92t an issue in Eco or Comfort modes. \\r\\nMind you, regardless of brake pedal feel, braking performance is excellent. The car is smart enough to always apply \\x91engine braking\\x92 when required, so that greatly aids the stopping power. Even on the racetrack, we didn\\x92t ever have the ABS intruding on hard braking.  Regenerative Braking \\r\\nAnother great trick the Kona has up its sleeve is the ability to fine-tune how much brake regen gets applied. The amount of battery recharge coming from these modes finally totals up to roughly the same thing, but what\\x92s different is the level of aggressiveness or immediacy of the regenerative brake force applied. You\\x92ll feel the regen kick in as soon as you begin to release the accelerator pedal. \\r\\nYou can adjust the level of regen by using the \\x91paddle shifters\\x92 behind the steering wheel. Pressing the left paddle increases the aggressiveness of the regen (think of it like downshifting), whilst pressing the right paddle eases up on the regen. \\r\\nThere are 5 different levels of regenerative braking that you can choose between: \\x95 Level 0: This effectively turns off the brake regen. When you lift your foot off the accelerator, there is absolutely no brake regen or engine braking applied. The Kona will continue to coast forward as if it were in neutral. Needless to say, no recharge happens when you lift off the accelerator pedal on Level 0. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 1: There\\x92s a reason this is the default regen level for Comfort & Sport modes. It is the closest in feel and behaviour to driving a normal car. I\\x92d advise Kona owners to get familiar with this level first, before exploring the more aggressive levels of regen. Lift off the accelerator here, and the car slowly starts to decelerate without a sudden jerk or alarming change in velocity. This is the most relatable level for first time EV drivers and will be comfortable for passengers too. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 2: If level 1 is like lifting off the gas pedal when at 80 km/h in 4th gear, level 2 is like doing the same thing when in 3rd gear instead. It\\x92s just a little more aggressive in deceleration. As expected, you\\x92d get more regenerative benefits from this before hitting the actual brakes, and that\\x92s why it\\x92s the default for Eco mode. When you\\x92re in a driving situation where you can plan your stopping (eg. traffic light or toll booth visible in the distance), you can easily rely on level 2 regen braking to do most of the work of bringing the car to a full halt. This would also be a great mode to use on steep mountain descents. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 3: Ever suddenly lift off the accelerator in 1st or 2nd gear? That\\x92s what level 3 regen feels like. In fact, when you first start using this mode and are still getting the hang of releasing the accelerator smoothly, you need to be careful that there are no vehicles right behind you. Thankfully, all regen braking also activate the Kona\\x92s brake lights! So why would you use this level of super-aggressive regen braking? Well, as you start to get used to it, you\\x92ll find yourself releasing the accelerator incredibly slowly, and in doing so, modulating the braking as well. Just imagine the accelerator is stuck to your foot, and you\\x92re pulling it back very slowly, rather than just lifting your foot off it. This can enable you to drive the car without the need to use the brake pedal, be it in city traffic or on the highway. Hyundai calls this \\x91one-pedal driving\\x92, and with a little practice, it certainly is possible \\x96 and the regen is hugely beneficial for the battery range. Sudden (unplanned) braking will still require you to use the good ol\\x92 brake pedal though. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 4: Well, there isn\\x92t really a \\x91level 4\\x92, but if you keep the left paddle pulled towards you it applies the maximum brake regen available. It is quite literally a \\x93hand-brake\\x94. You can use this trick regardless of what level (0-3) you\\x92re currently in, but for the time you have the paddle pulled, it will display \\x91level 3\\x92 on the instrument cluster. This can be used for bringing the car to a full halt quite easily. In fact, we used it often on the Buddh circuit to drop speed before turning into corners. What you need to be aware of here is that it\\x92s a very square braking profile; it\\x92s very sudden with no gradual increase in deceleration, and there\\x92s no way for you to modulate it using the paddle (which can be a bit unnerving if you\\x92re using it in traffic). Even though this is very sudden deceleration, it\\x92s still nowhere near the kind of stopping power you get with brakes \\x96 so this will not be replacing the brake pedal for emergency or quick braking situations. As soon as you release the paddle, the regen returns to the previous setting you were on, and if the car is at a standstill, it will remain there without moving forward, until you touch the accelerator or brake. EDIT: The brochure claims the stopping distance can be modulated by using the accelerator pedal whilst pulling the left paddle. Unfortunately, we did not get to try this whilst driving.Steering \\r\\nWhether driving on the track, on the highway or in the city, we had absolutely no complaints about the Kona\\x92s steering. This is usually a weak point for Hyundais, but they\\x92ve done a good job here. Let\\x92s be clear that it\\x92s far from an involving enthusiast steering, and it lacked feedback. But it\\x92s direct, weighs up nicely (a touch on the heavy side, even at city speeds) and it\\x92s got good on-centre feel. The average driver won\\x92t have any complaints at all.  Handling  \\r\\nHandling too is impressive for a car that is a crossover / SUV. Body roll is certainly present, but it is very well managed. The suspension is clearly sprung a little stiff, and having the weight of the battery at floorboard level helps keep the center of gravity low. Watching people clipping their test drive Konas through the chicane at BIC at 80-90 km/h, we could see the car roll a bit, but then hold itself there quite maturely. \\r\\nThe weakest link in the handling equation is the Nexen N\\'Fera SU1s. Despite being marketed as high-performance summer tyres, they left us wanting more. Even when driving through the Lonavala ghats, GTO said that he could feel the tyres losing grip way before the car wanted to, accompanied by the smell of burning rubber.  Ride Quality \\r\\nI\\x92ll be frank. The worst thing about the Kona is the ride quality. By a long shot. \\r\\nThe ride is taut and uncompromising. Think EcoSport, but worse. \\r\\nIt\\x92s uncomfortable on imperfect roads. Potholes, especially the big ones, come in bone-jarringly sharp. What\\x92s more, Rehaan says that even mild undulations on well-paved tarmac roads (eg. lightly wavering Marine Drive) had him being shaken up and down. If you were travelling along this same road in any other car, you wouldn\\x92t have even noticed this unless you were really paying attention. Even minor undulations on flyovers and on the expressway can be felt in the car. This is not a plush ride at all. \\r\\nInterestingly, we would have never figured this out during the media drive on the track. We got a tiny hint of it as we crossed an expansion joint in the garage lane, but this is something that only the real-world experience of driving on the road let us figure out. \\r\\nThe Kona has a surprisingly high recommended tyre pressure of 36 PSI. Could this be because of the weight of the car? Is it a way to improve battery range? We\\x92re not sure. But we did reduce the pressure to 32 PSI to see if it improved the ride \\x96 and the answer is; not much. Perhaps the stiff sidewalls of the Nexens are a contributing factor too. \\r\\nCombine the poor ride quality with the un-ergonomic seating position of the rear bench, and you\\'ll quickly realise that the Kona is far from ideal for rear seat passengers.  Ground Clearance \\r\\nThe Kona certainly doesn\\x92t have the ground clearance of an SUV, or even a crossovers. Hyundai did not share any official ground clearance figure with the press, despite many requests for it. There\\'s no doubt that it\\'s an unimpressive figure, especially for an \"SUV\". On extremely broken rural roads the Kona scraped where regular sedans would scrape (eg. Honda City). Even dressed-up hatchback crossovers would not scrape in these places. We faced no issues on urban speed breakers though. We measured the ground clearance of the Kona to be ~171 mm, however, this is a constant low-point (battery housing) across the entire wheelbase of the car, making it much more likely to bottom out.  NVH / VESS \\r\\nDespite the silence of an electric car making other sounds more noticeable, road noise was well controlled, and wind noise is barely present below 100 km/h.  \\r\\nThe silence of electric cars has made certain governments put requirements in place to have EVs make an audible sound when in motion, in order to warn pedestrians, cyclists, etc. I even found myself using the horn more often than I would have if I was driving a regular noisy car. The Kona has a Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS) to create somewhat of an audible warning, but more so to fulfil this legislative requirement. It turns itself on every time you start the car, but can be disabled by pressing the VESS button near the driver\\x92s right knee. Even with the system enabled, we could barely hear the difference (inside and outside the car). There was just a slight electric hiss / whine when the VESS was turned on, and surprisingly it was equally audible inside the cabin as it was outside of it. When VESS is enabled, a beeping sound plays when you put the car in Reverse gear \\x96 did you ever think reversing horns would come back in vogue? \\r\\nThe VESS sound was just about audible at the track, but may not be heard on our noisy streets. The system was manually switched on at the 00:16 mark in the video during a slow drive-by. You can also listen to the sound difference between the Tuscon (lead car) and the Konas down the main straight:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGsggVIMH44          \\r\\nThe engine bay layout is rather conventional. Remember, the Kona is also sold with gas-guzzling engines internationally:  \\r\\nPull off the plastic cladding, and this is what you\\'re left with. There is a LOT of free space in this engine bay:  \\r\\nYou get a regular 12V battery too. It charges off the main battery pack periodically:  \\r\\nIf you look deeper you can see the bell housing of the single-speed transmission:  \\r\\nInterestingly, the underside of the hood gets sound insulation:  \\r\\nThe firewall gets insulation too:  \\r\\nThe MID displays instructions on using the transmission selector, as well as displays which gear you select:  \\r\\nWhen you cup the strange bump with your hand, the PRND buttons fall at your fingertips, making them easier to operate without taking your eyes off the road:  \\r\\nWhen you switch the Drive Mode, the MID indicates what mode you\\'ve chosen:  \\r\\nThe infotainment screen also displays a full-screen notification:  \\r\\nThe Sport mode instrument cluster layout shows a \"Power %\" dial. Note the remaining km in the top right for this mode and the following ones:  \\r\\nComfort mode\\'s display is more traditional. The range displayed dead-center is convenient:  \\r\\nFor Eco mode the dial goes green, indicating the zone you should stay in. Note the increase in range (top right):  \\r\\nEco+ is the same as Eco, with an unchangeable 90 km/h limit. You\\'ll also be sweating it out without any climate control, but note the range bump:  \\r\\nThe additional km of range gained from regenerative braking is displayed in the Eco / Eco+ modes. This add-on counter resets each time you brake. Note the blue icon for the regen level (0-3) displayed below:  \\r\\nThe default regen level can be set for each drive mode. Every time you switch drive modes, the regen will always reset to this pre-defined level:  \\r\\nThe settings for each drive mode can be changed individually:  \\r\\nClimate control and energy regeneration can be adjusted for the \\x91Comfort\\x92 and \\x91Sport\\x92 driving modes:  \\r\\nFor Eco mode, the maximum speed limit can also be set. Eco+ is fixed at 90 km/h:  \\r\\nThe alert notification for a change in Drive mode can be selected too. You can disable the big pop-up on the infotainment screen: ', \"Other Points\\n•    The electric version of the Kona was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show and is sold in Australia, Canada, Europe, Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States. \\n•    In the international market, the Kona is also offered in conventional petrol, diesel and hybrid variants. They get slightly different exterior and interior design. \\n•    The Kona is named after the western district of Hawaii. The car is also called Kauai in Portugal and Encino in China. \\n•    Hyundai showcased the non-electric Kona Iron Man Edition at the 2018 Auto Expo. \\n•    The electric Kona was first seen testing in India in October 2018. \\n•    The electric Kona was showcased at Move: The Global Mobility Summit 2018 held in New Delhi in September 2018. \\n•    The Kona Electric is brought in as ‘Part-by-Part’ (PxP), which we're told is very similar to CKD. It is assembled at Hyundai's plant in Chennai. \\n•    Here's a controversial thought: Just like drivers of certain luxury brands or registration districts sometimes have a bad reputation, I wonder if the opposite will become true for cars with green number plates. Obviously the owners care enough about the planet to put their money where their mouth is, so maybe they will also be more responsible road users, exhibit better road manners and more civic sense? \\n•    When filing air at the pump, even the attendants there keep agreeing that this is the future, ironically “because diesel and petrol are becoming so expensive”. Everyone is impressed with the 280 km range. \\n•    Based on current electricity rates, the running cost of the Kona works out to a paltry 0.8 - 1.1 Rupees / km. GTO did Mumbai – Pawna – Mumbai in just 220 bucks. The cost is so insignificant that it'll be a rounding off error for most households. In fact, he paid more in tolls than he did for the electric charge. \\n•    I love that you can set the soft-touch turn indicator to either be off, 3 flashes, 5 flashes, or 7 flashes. The default 3 flashes in most cars is just too short. \\n•    Hill-hold prevents the Kona from rolling backwards on inclines. Another advantage of EVs - there’s no clutch slipping wear & tear during hill starts. People who have to park on a slope regularly will appreciate this. \\n•    Sometimes despite your foot being on the accelerator, you feel a difference in the Kona's resistance to moving forward when you change the regen braking level. This happens because even when your foot is pressing the accelerator, the car may just be coasting (not actively accelerating), and hence a change in the aggressiveness of the regen can be felt. \\n•    Regenerative braking does not work when in reverse gear. Also, you cannot change the current level of regen whilst your foot is on the brake pedal. \\n•    The official kerb weight has not been shared by Hyundai. Unofficial figures point to a hefty 1,535 kg for the 39.2 kWh version. Undoubtedly, the batteries make up a large part of the weight. \\n•    Service interval is every 10,000 km. Part of the air-conditioning system also helps cool the battery, and the coolant for this is changed at each service. \\n•    Standard warranty coverage is for 3 years / unlimited km. Extensions for the 4th and 5th years / 1,00,000 km can be purchased. We strongly recommend the max possible coverage available.  \\n•    Hyundai is providing roadside assistance to all new Konas for a period of 3 years from the date of sale. \\n•    Warranty coverage for the battery is 8 years / 1,60,000 km. The main concern with older EVs was that the battery would have to be replaced within a few years, increasing the ownership cost significantly. An 8-year warranty will bring peace of mind to the owners. \\n•    Service bays for the Kona get electrically insulated floor mats. Service personnel get insulated gloves and tools. \\n•    In July 2019, the government reduced the GST on electric cars from 12% to 5% and the price of the Kona reduced by Rs. 1.58 lakh. The government will also provide an additional income tax deduction of Rs. 1.5 lakh on interest paid on loans taken for the purchase of electric vehicles. \\n•    BHPian PPS brings to our notice that some states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan & Goa don't levy any road tax while registering EVs. \\n•    Hyundai says they have received 300 bookings so far, and as a result, all allocated units for India in 2019 have been sold out. \\n•    A Hyundai Kona EV in Canada caught fire in a garage recently. The cause hasn’t been conclusively determined as yet. \\n•    When setting up your charging station at home, do also account for the additional cost of wiring required from the meter box to your parking spot. BHPian sheldon.dz says that he paid Rs. 28,000 for the wiring that was installed by his building maintenance team. \\n•    Hyundai is expected to build a dedicated EV platform called E-GMP, which will have flexible battery capacity and a high voltage system to reduce charging time. \\n•    View the Hyundai Kona Electric brochure (Kona_Brochure.pdf), and the owners manual (Kona_Owners_Manual.pdf). \\n•    Disclaimer: Hyundai invited Team-BHP for the Kona Electric test-drive. They covered all the travel expenses for this driving event.\", \"The Smaller yet Significant Things\\nThe Kona Electric is available in Marina Blue...  \\n...Phantom Black...  \\n...Typhoon Silver...  \\n...Polar White...  \\n...and Polar White with a Phantom Black roof.

A mass manufacturer launching a true international EV with all the service support, long warranties and respectable range. This is entirely different from all the gimmicks Tata and Mahindra have been doing. Hyundai to me is the best car manufacurer in India now. Sometimes I think their second position in Indian market is by choice. They have everything that is needed to dethrone Suzuki if they wish. \\nKona can be a great urban commuter. Even though you spend 23 lakhs, the fuel expenses over the 8 year period will be surprisingly lower compared to the ICE cars. 1 Re per km is very cheap. For a monthly running of 1500kms, I pay about 7000 Rs per month for diesel with average FE of 15km per litre. That takes my 8 year fuel expense to 6-7 lakhs, while for a Kona it would only be 1.5 lakhs. At the end of 8 years, I dont think my diesel car would fetch any resale value, becaue the world will be electric by then. So it kind of makes sense to go for this even if it is expensive by 5-6 lakhs, because you will save on fuel costs and the resale value will be almost nil for diesel counter parts in a decade.', \"Great detailed review as usual from Team-BHP.   \\r\\nHyundai is able to develop one of the most efficient EVs using their existing petrol vehicle platforms.

I see still a few issues for this:  \\nWouldn't a 7.2 kWh charging point require load sanction and special meter from the distribution company - I know because BEST has several rules regarding high loads being connected.  \\nOur urban system of apartments and parking will not easily allow for charging infrastructure - e.g. Parking spots are supposed to be rotated every year and even if one does have a permanent spot / garage in an urban area (a rare luxury indeed) no other car could be parked there. I am not even getting into the street parking issues. Then probably the fast charger would be best - go have your morning chai/coffee at an IOC pump while your electric is being juiced up!  \\nPresent lack of standardisation - Kona will have one type of charger/socket/voltage specifications, the Tata Tigor EV another and say the Mahindra/Maruti a third. How many charging stations will one install in a multi-car household? If I do invest in a Kona, 5 years down the line battery or charging technology will change and after the battery life is over in 7-8 years, it will simply become a dead duck.  \\n Economic calculations seem to be way off yet and polluting aspects of Li-ion/Polymer and additional thermal power generation required are very debatable. Even for lead acid batteries we have a very poor record (and it is how lead is getting into our food chain). If one counts the interest cost of Rs. 12-15 lakhs EV premium at 7%, it will easily match or be higher than average annual fuel costs net of electricity costs at current levels and you still have that 12 lakhs in your bank/pocket.  \\nSafety aspect of batteries have not yet been fully sorted out in mobiles/electronics - early days of fossil fuels also saw enough incidents - this may yet take some time.   \\n In your other thread many have pointed out other aspects and issues of EVs. That being said, the following will make the move to EVs much more feasible - my opinion only:  \\n1. Start EVs for public transport - local trains and metros are a great example of electric power being used for mobility. The DTC/BEST, etc. can install required charging stations at the depots, use solar, etc. and setup recycling facilities.  \\n2. Start setting standards for EVs so that universal charging stations can be set up everywhere - don't we use a common micro-USB or USB C charger for our mobiles? Then apartment complexes, parking lots, etc. can set this up and we even can have street stations with meters being used based on pay as you go/use principles.  \\n3. Once basic standards are set, dis-incentivise private mobility using fossil fuels by raising taxes on fuels.  \\nThese are just a few that occur. But yes, enjoy the way the EVs accelerate for now. I envisage a future where we will have only auto / self driving Uber/Lyft/Ola electric pods controlled by AI where you just key in where you want to go on your app (or Google/Siri/Alexa). You will not be allowed to own or drive any personal mobility vehicle/car. If you can't afford the surge pricing wait to hop on to an electric bus/metro...\", 'A much awaited review.

I live in an independent house and I expect that those living in apartments may have a different take on this. \\nI will dedicate this post only to the charging issues as most else has been alluded to in the original post. \\n1. The company doing the installation of the level 2 charger visited my house once the car was allocated. He, in discussion with our layout electrician, worked out the wiring and additional fitments required.The following was installed: \\na)The power was drawn from just after the meter with large gauge wires running to the designated location of installation of charger. \\nb)upgraded fuses and cutouts- there is a 63A cutout installed just before the charger. Another 15A plug installed with it's own cutout for the level 1 charger. \\nc)Application made to BESCOM to enhance the load from 5KV to 7.5KV for the house. \\n2. Once the car was delivered, with both level 1 and 2 chargers in the boot, the technician from the installation company came back and guided installation of the charger.  \\n3. The level 1 charger is connected to the aforementioned 15A plug and works well. \\n4. However, I am having troubles with the level 2 charger. It is drawing 30A of current (which is the limit that the electricity meter can handle). My electrician advices me that running this for long can damage the meter as well as the cabling from the house to the transformer. So I haven't been able to use this yet. The last time I tried, the fuse to the house blew. Another attempt after fixing this resulted in the 30A draw and we aborted the experiment. \\nSo as it stands, though I have been provided the level 2 charger by Hyundai, I am unable to use it.I have to use the trickle charger (Level 1) that draws about 3.5A current. \\nSo, there are real-world problems here. My options as I can think of are as below: \\n1. Ask to increase the load to 15KV to the house. This is going to be a challenge as all the wiring and the meter will need changing and the electricity bill will shoot through the roof! \\n2. Wait for the 7.5KV load to be sanctioned and try again. Not sure this will work as the meter is maxing out at 30A \\n3. Re-adjust the settings in the charger to allow a maximum of 15-20A current draw. It has this facility. But the guys who did the installation are \\nnot keen to do this and they are not sure of warranty etc will be effected - though I am not sure I understand how! \\n4. Make adjustments in the car to set the maximum current draw to minimum or medium (though what the actual current drawn will be is not mentioned) \\nTo summarise the car seems to need 30A to charge with the level 2 charger (5-6 hours for 0-100% charging). This 30A cannot be obtained without major work rewiring and electrical work AND and upgrade of electricity supply from BESCOM and increased electricity bills. I would like to be proven wrong on this.... \\nSo, that's were we are at present. Please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.

Does this mean the lithium ion batteries wont catch fire when deformed or when under impact?    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire debate about electric cars being a fire hazard is pointless. Let's take the example of the Teslas that caught fire. All of the fires were the result of drivers running over roadway debris that directly damaged the battery cells, but no one in the vehicles was injured in any of the accidents. In fact, later data supported the conclusion that had the same roadway debris struck a vehicle without the battery cells and their aluminum plate protective covering, then the occupants of the vehicle most likely would have been badly injured or even killed by debris piercing the floorboard of the car. \\r\\nWhen compared to the flammability of conventional fuels, Li-ion batteries pose a far lower risk of fire or explosions. In cases of vehicular fires that were the result of damaged Li-ion batteries, the fire was limited to the area where the batteries were contained before it could be extinguished. \\r\\nIn fact, more than a collision, the major issue with Li-ion battery cells is that they can generate enough heat, sometimes during their normal operation and at other times due to short-circuit or external damage, to cause a reaction known as \\x93thermal runaway.\\x94  \\r\\nHowever, to address the issue, the vehicle\\x92s batteries are typically surrounded by a protective cooling shroud filled with chilled liquid coolant from a traditional-style automotive radiator. Which is why we are seeing a standard coolant bottle in all of the pics of the engine bay of electric test mules. In the event the batteries do overheat despite their external cooling, batteries in all models of electric vehicles are installed in an array rather than as one large battery pack. These battery clusters are further divided by firewalls that limit the amount of damage each is capable of causing if it were to malfunction. \\r\\nBottomline, the batteries are safe. And in future, we'll probably get solid state batteries which don't rely on electrolytes so the risk of a fire is further mitigated.\", \"Thank you for your patient reply, you have me convinced. Just one last question - if you see the KONA NCAP testing, the bottom isn't stressed. Do they hit the floorboard where batteries lie & should they modify tests for Electric Vehicles?

Just playing the devil's advocate here.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe batteries are usually completely enclosed in the battery case and integrated in the vehicle to protect the battery from all conceivable stresses and external influences. This “armour” has an effect on construction, weight, size and overall design of the vehicle.  \\nBut your observation is correct. The crash test in itself isn't specifically tailor made for electric vehicles. Too little research has been done into the behaviour of battery components under crash conditions.  \\nI've driven in countries like Italy where the tarmac is smooth and barely any speed breakers or broken roads. Electric cars being tested there will pass with flying colors.  \\nIn India , the risk of an impact from below is high. A friend's Honda City got hit from below rupturing the engine oil pan and draining all the engine oil risking engine seizure. There's a team bhp thread about the same issue which you can read here (Underbody Hit & Cracked Sump : Implications, Vulnerabilities, Responsibilities).If you see the battery placement on the Kona, it eats into the ground clearance substantially as the battery pack hangs below the floor sails, thereby also at a higher risk for underbody impact. There is some protection though but it's something which will be tested. It remains to be seen what's the battery placement on the MG ZS EV.  \\nI'm sure that the cars have been tested in Indian conditions but I do feel the early adopters will be guinea pigs as far as this aspect is concerned. India specific problems owing to road conditions, extreme weather and lack of knowledge about EVs are just around the corner.\", \"Speed breakers in Bangalore are 'bottom breakers'. I was on a site visit in the Eon and came across a 'mammoth mountain like' speed breaker near Ramanagara (outskirts), couldn't avoid it on time though speed was at 60 Kmph, and there was a thunderous sound with the bottom ripped off and suspension hanging. Being a Sunday, I was apprehensive of being attended to - but Hyundai promptly rescued me from that situation in no time. The guy was shocked at the amount of damage caused. This incident remains in my memory, so the apprehension.\", \"Unfortunately, those type of speed breakers are built by idiots who think bigger the speed bump slower the vehicles and safer it is, what they don't get is the damage it can cause when a speeding car encounters it.

Of course the later is for a more relaxed driving style, suited especially to city driving conditions but the former also allows for regen whenever you want to decelerate. With these many options for regen, the best and the most effective way to recuperate kinetic energy during breaking is to use the break pedal itself, and and at times the left - \"1 pedal driving\" feature.   \\r\\nI absolutely agree but I haven`t been on a long trip with my Kona EV until yesterday. I was very skeptical as there are no EV charging infra available in my chosen route, or for any national highways for that matter. Having said that, its important to understand the limitations of an EV on a graded basis. How well you actually know its going to perform, unless you take the road less traveled, makes sense when you have maximum options to consider for any untoward situations or scenarios.

The co-founder Maxson Lewis, was kind enough to discuss & talk to me about the various charging points and also his plans. I just wanted to spread the good word around for all you EV Owners, based on my discussion with him:Magenta Power is a Govt of India approved company for setting up charging stations. Magenta Power has a few charging stations in and around Mumbai. They are planning more stations in Pune as well. But their priority is Lonavala, as it would help commuters between the 2 cities. HPCL is an investor in their company. So, I expect to see a few charging stations set up in & around HPCL's. In fact, they are also trying to wrap up the discussion with Hyundai for Kona. They have a charging station along the expressway right after the Lonavala exit bridge ends (while driving from Pune to Mumbai). However, right now, it only supports the various Mahindra EV's like Tigor & Verito. Not yet for the likes of Kona & ZS. For us, we'll have to use the 16 AMP socket to charge up. This is about to change in about 10 odd days from today. They should have a 50 KW CCS TYPE 2 charger ready.  This should certainly help us. After Lonavala, the plan is to expand here in Pune, then going down further South along the Bangalore route. I did ask him to do something for the Goa route.  He also has plans for down south as well. \\r\\nAll in all, things are shaping up pretty well and is starting to look good. I hope his tie-up with Hyundai works out well, as it would mean, we don't have to be overly stingy / have range anxiety - about our rides to/from Mumbai / Pune.  \\r\\nLong run, it would also mean we would have a better support network on highways, away from cities. \\r\\nI wish the very best to Maxson & his team and hope he's able to set up a good support network along major routes....at least between Mumbai & Pune to begin with. I hope this piece of information is useful for everyone here. \\r\\nNow, I'm eagerly looking forward to my Kona and to my drive to Mumbai on Kona and juicing it up on the 50KW fast charger at Lonavala. \\r\\nEDIT: Just remembered, they have plans for Hyderabad and Chandigarh as well!!!

Tata Motors leads the way with the Tigor EV (priced at Rs. 12.49 - 13.64 lakh) and Nexon EV (priced at Rs. 14.79 - 19.24 lakh), while MG sells the ZS EV (priced at Rs. 22.00 - 25.88 lakh), which is the most sorted EV this side of the luxury marques. There is also the Mini Electric, priced at 48.70 lakh. These cars are doing well in their respective price brackets and since there are no other electric models on offer in their segments, they are ruling unchallenged. \\nThen, there is a big price jump and the EVs in the next segment (Audi e-tron, BMW iX, Jaguar I-Pace and Mercedes EQC) are priced around Rs. 1 crore. \\nNow, Kia is entering the EV market in India with the EV6 “crossover”, which is aligned to what the company terms “Techno Green Innovation”. The car will be brought to India through the CBU route (VIN details indicated that the cars used for the drive at Buddh International Circuit were built in Korea). The EV6 will be positioned above the Carnival in Kia’s product portfolio, making it the new flagship product. During the presentation, there was reference to the Tesla Model Y, which should be an indicator as to how Kia plans to price the EV6. We expect it to be priced in the range of Rs. 60 - 75 lakh. This will mean that the car has no challengers in its price bracket, at least till the time the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Volvo XC40 Recharge are launched. Kia has allotted 100 units for the Indian market for the first year and bookings will open on May 26, 2022.  \\nThe EV6 is Kia’s first ground-up EV. It is based on Hyundai Group\\'s Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) and features Kia\\'s \"Opposites United\" design philosophy. It will be offered with a permanent magnet synchronous motor and a 77.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The battery supports ultra-fast charging, which adds 100 km of range in 4.5 minutes. It can be recharged from 10% - 80% in 18 minutes using a 350 kW fast charger (good luck finding that in India), while a 50 kW fast charger takes 73 minutes for the same. \\nKia claims that the EV6 offers a range of more than 500 km as per European test norms (AER). It is expected to manage perhaps over 500 km in ARAI tests. The car’s homologation is going on and the exact range will be announced during the launch on 2nd June.  \\nThe EV6 will be offered in the GT Line trim with both, single motor and dual-motor variants. The single motor RWD variant packs 226 BHP and 350 Nm, while the AWD version produces 222 BHP & 350 Nm at the front / 98 BHP & 255 Nm at the rear. That’s a combined output of a whopping 321 BHP and 605 Nm!  \\nThe exterior design is very bold and stylish with sleek lines and contours that run all along the body line + the bonnet. Smart use of design elements can be seen all over the car. For a change, everything somehow falls in place without anything glaringly standing out, which hasn\\'t been the case with many new cars. This car looks very sharp and would be well accepted by a wide audience, without polarising opinions. The EV6 rides on 19\" alloy wheels shod with 235/55 section tyres. What’s noteworthy is that the car’s ground clearance has been increased from 165 mm to 178 mm for India! Very, very important IMHO.  \\nThe car will come in 5 colours – Moonscape (our personal favourite), Snow White Pearl, Runaway Red, Aurora Black Pearl and Yacht Blue. The Aurora Black reminded me of my friend\\'s Standard (Rover) 2000, which he had painted shiny jet black, back in the 1990s.  \\nThe interiors, on the other hand, come in only one colour option, which is black. The quality and feel of the materials used is mostly very good and there are some nice, premium touches like the checkered finish on the passenger side of the dashboard and brushed aluminum on the central console. However, if you are expecting premium-class wood veneer and polished surfaces, you are in for a disappointment. On the other hand, you can expect everything to be well put together and long lasting, made with European flavor in abundance. While the cars used for our preview drive had different materials for the seats, the ones that will be sold in India will have black suede & off-white vegan leather upholstery. The choice of “vegan” is part of Kia’s green initiatives for the future. I found the front seats to be super comfortable. They have all the adjustments one will normally ask for. The seats are sporty and super supportive.  \\nWhile the black interiors will not get soiled easily, the dark shade of the upholstery along with the sloping roof line at the back, makes rear seat passengers feel claustrophobic. Rear legroom is abundant, especially with the front seats moved forward or even set for sub-6-foot-tall front users. The flat floor helps in extracting more space at the rear. The downside is that, with the overall raised floor due to the battery placement, the under-thigh support is negligible. This is not really a car for sitting in the rear seat on long drives. \\nLuggage space is good enough with a 520L boot, and a 20L (AWD) or 52L frunk (RWD). The boot floor has an additional removable section, which can increase the loading area depth by about 2 inches. It can also be used to store valuables out of sight. There is no spare wheel, not even a space saver! No tools provided either. This will pose major problems in real life driving conditions as India isn\\'t like Europe or USA where you can try roaming without a spare wheel. A subwoofer, along with the rest of the EV stuff, occupies the place of the spare wheel, jack and tools.  \\nOne needs to be cautious while folding the rear seatbacks from the boot. While it is super convenient, pulling the lever folds the seats rather hard and fast. So, if there are delicate items kept on the rear seat, expect them to be crushed. The folding mechanism is built tough, but that makes it equally tough to pull the seat back in place.  \\nThe young tech-savvy entrepreneur, who according to Kia is the potential customer, will expect a lot at the price at which the EV6 is likely to be launched. So, it is inevitable that the car has to be very well equipped. Kia has loaded the EV6 with all the features one would expect. Some of the features available include dual 12.3\" screens, 10-way power-adjustable front seats with memory function for the driver\\'s seat, suede & vegan leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, UV cut glasses, paddle shifters for regeneration, multi-drive modes, connected car technology, adaptive headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, vehicle-to-load and a wireless smartphone charger. The GT-Line AWD variant (which we drove) comes with an Augmented Reality head-up display, powered tailgate, sunroof (not panoramic), automatic flush-fitting door handles and a Meridian sound system with 14 speakers. \\nIf the geek in you wants to see what the 12.3\" screens can do, go ahead and check out this link. You scan a QR code on the system to get this link on your smartphone. Let me assure you that it will take at least half a Sunday for you to just go through the various menus and settings on this one. Good thing that most of them are, at best, 3-4 clicks deep. \\nOn the safety front, the EV6 comes equipped with 8 airbags, 360-degree camera, adaptive LED headlights, all-wheel disc brakes with ABS and brake assist, ESC, hill-start assist control, multi collision brake assist, VSM as well as ADAS. The list of ADAS features includes forward collision avoidance assist, lane keep assist, safe exit assist, lane follow assist, blind-spot detection with collision-avoidance assist, rear-cross traffic alert and smart cruise control with stop & go functionality. All the radar-based systems are configured for the real world and hence, would not work on a wide track like the Buddh International Circuit. Some of the instructors managed to get lane guidance working in a few corners. \\nYou will never run out of charging points in this car. You can use this EV as a massive power bank to charge your gadgets and gizmos...and then some. At the front, there are two USB ports, two 12V power outlets and a wireless charging pad. Rear passengers get two USB ports and one full-fledged 250V 16A power outlet. Then, there is another power outlet in the boot. If these are not enough, one can easily run any household appliance including a microwave, plasma TV and even a refrigerator using the Vehicle to Load (V2L) connection. We’re not kidding! The plasma TV used for the presentation was powered from the display car! One can even help fellow EV owners with a top up, if they run out of juice through a Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) connection using a regular ICCB cable.  Driving the Kia EV6 \\nIt was our bad luck that it started raining cats & dogs at 6.00 AM in Greater Noida, and when we reached the Buddh International Circuit at 7.00 AM, there was a full-fledged storm. At 9.00 AM, it was not clear whether the track would be opened for the drive. We saw steel plates flying off and falling in the pit area, barely missing an EV6. Things somehow mellowed down and it was decided that we will have a brief session on the track. We were reminded multiple times of the conditions; these were normal street cars and needed to be treated accordingly. We started with an instructor at the wheel for a demo drive on a short loop of Buddh. The track was wet, but the car behaved well with moderately aggressive turn-ins. The traction control system along with the electric motors, makes it very safe and does not allow for any unwanted spins or slips like internal combustion engine cars. It feels and is very safe that way.  \\nThen came my chance to have my two short laps of the circuit. The longer lap was yet to be cleared for driving. Turn the jog dial from P -> D and start off slowly. The EV6 will drive just like any other car, minus the sound from the engine. Mind you, the only EV I had tried before this was an Ather - a small, peppy scooter that goes off with a “wheeee”. But in an EV6, there is absolute silence. There is no whine or any other audio feedback, unless you switch on the electronics which play different themes over the speaker. I would personally keep them off and instead, switch on the relaxing tones option and enjoy the Zen-like calm. Depending on the pressure on the accelerator pedal, the power drive will be gentle, mild or shove you back into the seat . \\nThere are 3 driving modes: Eco - Feels like how a normal 150-180 BHP turbo-charged car would. Normal - Gives you about 30% more rush. While keeping the A-pedal at the same position, you hit the drive mode button on the steering wheel to engage Normal mode from Eco and the car will lunge forward eagerly with this change. There is a remarkable difference. Race - Lets all the kW’s into the motor and makes it a maniac. Expect yourself to be shoved back into the seat with the passengers screaming. We did a dash from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.6-ish seconds with 3 adults in the car. In a matter of seconds, you are doing silly speeds. This car has an electronically-limited top speed of 192 km/h and we could easily achieve that on the straight stretches of the track, even in wet conditions! There is absolutely no wheel spin or drama. The electric motor along with the electronics ensures that all the power is put on the ground and not even 1 kW is wasted. Snow - This mode is hidden. One needs to press and hold the mode button to activate it. We missed driving in this mode, but I guess it is for tricky, slippery conditions that you find in cold countries during the winter. The same mix of electric motors and the various stability programs can make the driving experience very uninvolving and boring on turns. In a normal internal combustion engine car, there is a lot of feedback that the driver will receive from the steering, engine, gearbox and brakes. In an EV, there is just the steering and then, the regen braking and normal brakes. The missing engine makes a huge difference to the driving experience for someone new to EVs.  \\nThe regenerative braking system has four levels, from mild to hard. This can be quickly accessed by using the paddles, which is well thought out. It’s just like using the paddles for downshifting to get more and more engine braking. In the highest regen mode, this vehicle can be driven with just the A-pedal. The regen braking can bring the vehicle to a stop. Hence, a keen and focussed driver would be able to recover a lot of lost energy during normal driving, enhancing the usable range. Then, there is “Auto” mode, which adjusts the regen braking based on various parameters including radar-guided cruise control (if activated) or on driver inputs. When I tried to use the paddles in Auto mode, the system kept flashing a message saying, “conditions are not met”, so I assume the paddles were being bypassed or the braking, along with the wet conditions, did not allow it to get more aggressive. Personally, I am a big fan of this regen braking, especially with the paddles. I felt that brings some fun and involvement into driving an EV. \\nHandling-wise, the car is very neutral. You can push it extremely well. I have driven normal ICE cars such as the Volkswagen Polo GTi, Jaguar F-Type, Mercedes AMG and BMW M cars, and ridden shotgun in Ferraris on tracks around the world and all of them need a good deal of driver attention in corners or they will bite back, squirm and squeal. The EV6 - on the other hand - just goes around corners like it’s on rails. The electronic aids plus the electric motor would be terrific for track times once people master it. Again, there is no intrusive traction control cutting in. It is all seamless. During the entire drive, only one momentary intervention I could sense was in the steering and that too when I took an aggressive turn + the wheels were on the wet kerbs. The whole car with its sound deadening, EV tech, etc. make it a very Zen-like place to be. One would love it or hate it, missing all the sensory feeling of riding in a normal motor car (sorry internal combustion engine car), while there would be others who appreciate the refinement.  \\nComing to the ride, the EV6 seems to be decent from our experience when we tried it on whatever undulated surfaces we could find inside the circuit, but it would be foolish to say it is great from just this drive. I feel the suspension set up is on the stiffer side, but definitely does not feel like a bone-jarring one. We\\'ll be driving this car on regular roads soon and will update the thread. \\nFront end features a sleek clamshell bonnet along with adaptive LED headlamps, and an angular lower bumper that accentuates the width of the car:  \\nRear is where you will see some bulk, but those LED lamps with a jewel like arrangement for the turn-indicators are pretty neat:  \\nThe side is the best angle to view the car from, with the character lines clearly visible. There is a silhouette puddle light that is hidden on the C-pillar (yes, C-pillar):  \\nCloser look at the headlamp cluster with integrated multi-array front indicators:  \\nFully protected and absolutely flat undercarriage.

Otherwise, they look like brushed aluminium jewels. Neat touch:  \\nHere is the EV6 in the Aurora Black Pearl paint. How many of you are reminded of the Standard 2000? A modern take on it, I feel:   \\nInteriors are clean and elegant. Everything is well put together, with the right amount of stylish inserts:  \\nThe displays seem to be the right size and not just a huge tablet in your face. There are two screens here - one for the infotainment head-unit and a second one for the instrument cluster:  \\nSeats have the right bolstering and the headrest is not intrusive, although it looks like the face of ET:  \\nThis is the Zero G position of the front seats where one can relax, while getting a quick top up. We rate it A+. It\\'s very comfortable without any pressure applied on the back. However, operating the switch to do it right is not easy:  \\nTouch controls have a mode button where the function changes from HVAC to media. This is tricky at first, yet easy to get used to and efficient use of space. Still, people may accidentally turn up the temperature instead of the volume:  \\nIt is a maze under the dash and you can see the power lines too:  \\nThe downside of all the design touches and battery being underneath. Your leg will get dirty if you are not careful. Shorter folks will find it a stretch to reach the ground:  \\nNormally, the rear passenger has negligible under-thigh support:  \\nWith the front seat pushed ahead, the rear passenger can stretch his legs and then, the under-thigh support is alright. But this is not a very comfortable position to sit in for long:  \\nThis is not a large sneaker that I am wearing, yet there is no place underneath the front seat to put my feet:  \\n250V, 16A socket is a rare phenomenon even at homes as it is used only for heavy appliances. You can set up a full fledged office with this:  \\nSmall quarter glasses are the biggest reason to find it claustrophobic at the rear. Passengers will have their heads next to them while they are seated:  \\nNo dearth of space to carry that stuff for weekend camping. Rear seatbacks fold forward in a 60:40 ratio:  \\nNotice the removeable boot floor. You can get 2 more inches of depth. Can store some valuables away from prying eyes here:  \\nFolding the rear seat backrests gives you a luggage capacity of 1,300 liters. You can remove the parcel shelf. A camping bed can be easily accommodated along with a sleeping bag:  \\n20-liter frunk is pretty much useless. That is an iPhone X kept in it to give you an idea about its size:  \\nKia claims this is India\\'s fastest charger with all of 180 kW and set up at Buddh.

It is available at 15 dealerships across 12 cities and the booking amount has been set at Rs 3 lakh.   \\nKia initially plans to import 100 units via the CBU route. The car is available in a single GT Line trim. The official launch will take place next month. \\nThe Kia EV6 is based on the Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP). It comes with a permanent magnet synchronous motor and a 77.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that is said to offer a maximum range of 528 km (WLTP cycle). The battery supports ultra-fast charging, which adds 100 km of range in 4.5 minutes. It can be recharged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes using a 350 kW fast charger, while a 50 kW fast charger takes 73 minutes. \\nIn India, the EV6 is offered in single motor and dual-motor variants. The single motor RWD variant packs 226 BHP and 350 Nm, while the AWD version produces 321 BHP and 605 Nm. \\nThe Kia EV6 comes equipped with LED headlamps with Adaptive Driving Beam and Connected LED tail lamps with sequential turn indicators. The car rides on 19-inch alloy wheels. \\nInside, the EV6 gets panoramic dual 12.3-inch curved displays, a head-up display, a Meridian sound system with 14 speakers, an electric sunroof, seats that recline at a press of a button and cruise control with stop & go functionality.', \"Great review. It had all the details one could ask for.  \\nThis has now replaced my dream of a BMW 3 series. The muscle car looks and performance that can smoke even supercars.

And what do you think about resales of EV more so, say an EV6 vs an i4?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nTo address the questions you raised:   Will someone buy a Kia for (say) 60L - 70L. \\nI think the market has already crossed the point of maturity where buyers are willing to pay German car like money for non German / non luxury marquees.  The Camry and Fortuner are two examples.  One may say strong Toyota brand for those two examples, to which closer home, Kia too has established that POC to some extent via the Carnival.  \\nIf the product is specced right, built right, and priced (within reason) right, I think people will not reject it merely because its a Kia.  Lack of direct luxury competition sometimes also helps.   \\nIf I was in the market today for an EV with a 60-70 lakh budget and my choices were the XC 40 Charge vs the EV6 / Ioniq, I would not pick the Volvo merely because its Volvo or reject the Kia / Hyundai merely because of the badge.  I’d judge each on its individual merits.  From images at least, I feel the Kia really hits the sweet spot on every metric that I value.   \\nThe back seat seems acceptably comfortable, the front for my small frame should be adequate, it has the right level of range, great luggage space with good modular flexibility and decent crossover spec ground clearance. The fact that it almost looks like a muscle car and has been very tastefully designed only strengthens its case.   \\nThe issue of course is that its just that tad bit pricey (specially in MH) being a CBU.  If this was within 60L on road, I’d actively consider it if I was in the market and it ticked all other boxes right.    Resale \\nHard to comment on this.  These are niche products released in limited numbers at prices not palatable to everyone.  \\nOne way to look at this: the combination of these factors means there should at least be some demand for this in the used market as well given that units coming up for resale will be limited and the depreciated price at which these could hit the market might be more palatable to a slighter wider group set.   \\nThe counter argument is that the market is deepening and more offerings will come across a broader price range.  If that is the case, buyers might have many more new car options as the market deepens and expensive initial offerings like an i4 would have to compete with a new offering like Kia EV6.  Heck, even a 2 year old Kia EV6 may have to compete with a brand new Ioniq that might be meaningfully cheaper and substantially similar.   \\nI think it’ll depend on product by product but this here sounds like the more real threat to expensive new EVs purchased in 2022/ 23.', \"I think Kia will sell these 100 cars in no time. It's an easy and very obvious choice for the well-heeled looking to add an EV flavour to their well-stocked garage. The stock will be sold out by the time discerning buyers/fence-sitters make up their mind. \\nHaving said that it's not such an easy decision for those looking for their main car as it's difficult to rule out the product offerings from EU cars. It's best not to do any FOMO (fear of missing out) purchase and explore options with patience. Things will only get better when it comes to EV cars (not sure about the prices!!)\", 'Kia won\\'t want to sell over 100 cars and I doubt they can. In many big markets (e.g. USA), the EV6 has a waiting list and some dealers are selling it for ABOVE MSRP prices. In Australia, the car is apparently sold out until 2025 (1500 orders).  \\nConsidering the lack of options between the MG ZS EV and the luxury marques, all 100 allocations of the EV6 will be done for soon.  \\nThis is simply a \"halo\" / marketing product to add some more shine to the brand. It\\'s not about sales numbers at all.', \"Kia has another blockbuster in its kitty with this EV6.

Such is the demand for the car it is even difficult to get a test drive and currently has 14 months waiting period.  \\r\\nFrom the pictures, i expected it to be a hatchback, maybe a little larger than VW Golf but I was wrong. The photos are deceiving, the car is huge - wheelbase is as long as Kia Telluride. I expected it to handle like a hot hatch. If we benchmark it against such hot hatches, EV6 is a disappointment. Once you realize are riding around in a 1.9 ton CSUV, you really start to appreciate the handling of RWD EV6. You can notice some body roll in the curves but it is on a league of its own if you benchmark it against any ICE CSUVs currently in the market. For a car weighing close to 2 tons, it is very brisk and regen does its job. Even when you press the pedal hard, there was no wheel slip at the rear at all. It is a wonderfully engineered car (or should one say SUV). If i had one complaint though, it was the steering feedback. In all the drive modes, i never felt connected to the road and was vague.

Our market is too small to manufacture EVs locally at the present time. Even CKD operations would still cost companies a lot more than they'll earn. Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, BMW bringing in much more affordable cars is definitely a sign of good things to come. Hopefully in a duty cut, maybe even local manufacturing to some extent. It is tougher to do with a BEV. Maybe cars like the XC40 and BMW ix3 which share the platform with ICE counterparts can be made here in CKD guise. Only time will tell though.

Not a car you just get into and start driving  This review has been jointly compiled with Vid6639. Thanks to him for the expert observations.   Introduction \\nThe EQS is the first Mercedes-Benz car that has been developed exclusively as an Electric Vehicle. Earlier this year, moderators vb-san and ajmat drove the EQS 580 4Matic and the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ in Germany and India, respectively. \\nIn August, Mercedes launched the AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ in India, and now, the company has introduced the EQS 580 4Matic. While the former is imported as a CBU, the latter is brought via the CKD route.  \\nThe EQS 580 4 Matic comes with two electric motors - one on each axle, and together, they produce 516 BHP and 855 Nm torque. These figures, along with the fact this is an EV (= instant and always-available torque), mean that you will giggle like a little baby when you floor the A pedal. The motors are powered by a 107.8 kWh battery pack, which will take you 600+ km on a single charge. That's Mumbai - Goa on a single charge. This also means you can do Mumbai - Pune - Mumbai twice or Delhi - Jaipur - Delhi or once. The likelihood of you doing that is slightly remote though. The motors get you from 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds, while the car's top speed is limited to 210 km/h.  \\nThe battery pack comes with an 8-year / unlimited km warranty and the service interval is 2 years / 30,000 km.\", 'Exterior  \\nMassive three-pointed star logo on the grille houses the front camera. The bonnet can only be opened / removed through a hidden, undisclosed lever under the dashboard. It is not supposed to be opened by the user and only by service personnel:   \\nThe rear gets 3D helix design elements in the LED tail-lamps:  \\nThe EQS is built on a dedicated EV platform and to accommodate a larger battery pack, the wheels are pushed to the edges, which means a massive 3,210mm wheelbase:  \\nWith a drag coefficient of 0.20, the EQS is claimed to be the most aerodynamic production car in the world. The swooping lines really turn heads on the road as well:  \\nAt the rear, you get a light bar connecting the tail-light clusters. Badging is distributed between the left and right:  \\nEach multi-beam headlight cluster uses Mercedes\\'s Digital Light Technology, which consists of a light module with three extremely powerful LEDs, whose light is refracted and directed by 1.3 million micro-mirrors. The resolution is therefore more than 2.6 million pixels per vehicle. The new headlamp can be recognized by its concave lens and the blue illuminated Mercedes-Benz lettering:  \\nPiano black panel with three-pointed star detailing in place of a radiator grille. The entire grille is illuminated with every small three-pointed star glowing in blue:  \\nORVMs house cameras for the 360-degree camera system and also puddle lamps that project the Mercedes-Benz branding:  \\nProminent EQS badging on the A-pillar:  \\nGiven that the bonnet is sealed, here\\'s where you put in the windscreen washer fluid. Press to open, while the car is unlocked:  \\nDoor handles remain flush with the door panels when locked. They will pop out when they sense proximity to the key, or when you press the request sensor on the handle. The downside to this is that if you\\'re standing close to the car with the key on you, the door handles will keep popping out:   \\nDoor handles get illumination:   \\nFrameless front and rear doors look great and add to the cool quotient of the overall design:  \\n20-inch wheels shod with 225/45 section Pirelli P Zero tyres. Luckily Mercedes didn\\'t opt for the 21 inchers that vb-san drove in Germany. The higher profile is a boon on our roads:  \\nCharging port is placed on the rear flank:  \\nGround clearance is not even enough to clear a typical 6.5\" phone:  \\nThe party trick of the EQS - 4-wheel steering! The car is 5,216 mm long with a wheelbase of 3,210 mm, but the 4-wheel steering makes those in-between-divider turns in the city effortless. Its turning circle of 10.9 m is lesser than the C-Class!  \\nWith the tail-lamps in action. Press the Mercedes-Benz logo to open the boot. It houses a Passat-style reversing camera: ', 'Interior\\nThe EQS 580 comes in two interior colour options - white and black. As you step into the cabin, you are greeted with a sea of screens that run the length of the dashboard. The screens on the passenger side and centre fascia are touch-enabled, while the one for the driver is controlled via the switches on the steering wheel - the ones on the right spoke to be specific. The switches on the left spoke control the infotainment head-unit, which can also be accessed through the controls near the armrest:  \\nLeather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel allows you to control everything in the car through the switches on the left and right spokes. These controls are touch-enabled, mind you and there\\'s a good chance you do something you didn\\'t intend to, as your hand moves the wheel. Paddle shifters allow you to toggle between the various regeneration modes - the left between Off & Normal, and the right between Intelligent & Strong:  \\nFully digital instrument cluster displays a host of information from driving parameters, navigation, driving modes and driving assist features. Remember, there\\'s no augmented reality in the Indian EQS:  \\nControls for the lights and parking brake are placed on the right of the steering wheel:  \\nDriver\\'s doorpad houses controls for the electrically adjustable seat, memory, heating & cooling and massage functions, door lock/unlock, ORVM adjustment and the hatch:  \\nSeating is low and one feels cocooned in. The front seats have limited adjustment:  \\nCentre fascia is the command centre of the car. A/C controls are touch-enabled:  \\nYou can control driver personalisation options, car settings, entertainment, driving and safety features and so on:  \\nHere\\'s a party trick. When you select the multi-colour option in ambient lighting, the lights on the door pads have their own little show going on! Very, very cool:  \\nThey tell you the direction of energy transfer - whether from the battery to the wheel, or the other way around:  \\nIf you are about to turn and there is someone in your blind spot (also displayed on the ORVM), the lights will flash in red to warn you:  \\nCentre console houses another set of controls - driver profile fingerprint scanner, engine start/stop button, driving modes, volume, 360-degree camera display and a shortcut to the car settings:  \\nUnder the armrest is a storage bin with two USB-C charging points and a wireless charging pad:   \\nRear doorpad houses switches for controlling seat heating & cooling functions and adjustment:  \\nA generous amount of ambient lighting even at the rear:  \\nThe rear seats can recline and are ventilated, but do not get a massage function. The middle passenger also gets a full-size headrest:  \\nLegroom in the rear is abundant:  \\nArmrest has a storage bin along with two USB-C ports and a wireless charging pad. It also houses a Samsung tab that has all the controls as the infotainment head-unit. Mercedes has not bothered to remove the Samsung branding:  \\nHeadroom is sufficient. At 6\\' 2\", Vid6639 was comfortable. However, sitting upright, there wasn\\'t much clearance left, which is typical of most luxury cars that have a coupe design:  \\nIndividual A/C controls for the rear passengers and a smaller storage area along with two USB-C ports. Climate control system has a HEPA filter that maintains interior AQI to about 1 PM2.5:  \\nFront seatbacks have small pockets to stow the sahib\\'s magazines:  \\nThe EQS is a notchback so the opening is huge. Luggage space is enormous!   \\nNo spare tyre. Instead, there is a shallow underfloor tray to store the charging cables:  \\nButtons to close / adjust the boot opening height: ', 'Driving the EQS 580 4Matic\\nThe 107.8 kWh battery churns out an exciting 516 BHP and a gut-wrenching 855 Nm through 2 electric motors. Press the power button after you have set your profile with biometrics (or Face ID) and you get a \"READY\" light on the instrument cluster indicating that the EQS is all set. Press the throttle normally as you would in any car and the EQS moves off the line silently and smoothly. It\\'s very usable and smooth inside the city with normal throttle inputs. As with any EV, the torque is instant and overtaking is a breeze. You can close gaps in traffic with a slight nudge to the throttle and with no delay. It makes the experience of driving this 5.2 m long 2.5 ton behemoth effortless.  \\nThe accelerator pedal is easy to operate initially, but it has a lot more weight / resistance as you push it further and when you do floor it, you will know why. Press hard down, and I do not exaggerate when I say this, your stomach will curl as the electric motors work their magic. The acceleration is intense and brutal on your senses. Vid6639 punched the throttle when I wasn\\'t expecting and it was like someone punching you into the seat. A 0-100 km/h time of 4.3 secs in something so big and heavy is like defying the laws of physics. Of course, Tesla owners are used to it, but in India, this is still rare with not many fast EVs around. Once you taste this acceleration, it becomes addictive and you keep doing it just to experience the insane \"whoosh\". It makes overtaking on single-carriageways ridiculously easy. The fun is mainly between 0-120 km/h. The EQS will comfortably touch 210 km/h, which is the limited top speed (we, obviously, didn\\'t test this).  \\nThe EQS comes with four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport and Individual. As with most luxury cars, the steering, throttle response and suspension settings change depending on the drive mode engaged. Sport mode gives the steering a lot more weight and makes the throttle ridiculously sensitive. This mode is not even an option to try inside town. Most of the time, we drove in Comfort mode and it was more than enough. In the Individual mode, you can configure each of the parameters to your preference and save it for whenever you want to engage it again. \\nIn Sport mode, you can also enable ambient sounds. It\\'s a very gimmicky feature but adds a cool factor to it. There are 2 sounds - \"Silver Waves\" and \"Vivid Flux\" - to choose from. When you press the throttle, the sound coming from the speakers is like a spaceship taking off and very sci-fi.   Range and Charging \\nWhile the range of 850 km sounds impressive, this is based on the MIDC or ARAI-based calculation. The real-world range will be closer to the WLTP figure of 677 km. After driving the EQS 580 for the better part of the day, we are very confident that anyone can do 600+ km on a full charge unless you drive like a complete hooligan, flooring the A pedal at every opportunity (like Vid6639). \\nThis sort of range takes away any range anxiety. This one-charge driving distance lets you complete road trips on most popular routes easily. We got the car when it had a range of ~ 650 km and after our drive, which included Chakan-Lonavala-Khopoli and then through the city, there was still ~ 350 km left. Mind you, this was across a jammed Pune-Mumbai Expressway, peak-hour bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city, and a generous amount of really flooring the A pedal many, many times (in the interest of testing of course). \\nThe battery comes with both AC and DC charging ports. A 15 minute quick charge gets you 300 km of range provided you use the fast DC charger. A full charge, using a 15A socket, will take more than a day. So, you will need at least a 3 phase fast charger at home. Alternately, with this sort of range, you may only be charging the car 2-3 times a month, which can be managed at a dealership or any fast charger en route. The fact that daily charging is not needed with this range, is really a game changer for EVs.   Suspension Ride and Handling \\nThe EQS gets Mercedes AIRMATIC air suspension with adaptive dampers known as ADS+. The system is similar to what you get in the S-Class. Using sensors at the front, the car detects the road surface and sets the damping at each wheel dynamically. As a result, the EQS rides very plush at slow speeds and when pushed, doesn\\'t roll a lot in spite of its weight. There is a firm edge to the suspension, which is noticeable when you hit a sharp bump hard. But other than that, nothing much filters into the cabin especially in Comfort mode. Everything tightens up in Sport mode with more of the surface being transmitted inside the cabin. But the ride becomes a lot flatter as speeds go up. \\nThe AIRMATIC system also keeps the ride height constant. Based on the load, the ground clearance is maintained at the same level. At speeds below 40 km/h, you can raise the height by 25 mm for speed breakers, but even in the raised position, the ground clearance is nothing to write home about. We scraped plenty of speed breakers including some that most cars could glide over. The huge 3,210 mm wheelbase makes it even more tricky as it is not even possible to take some speed breakers diagonally. This is not a car for most Indian cities. The USP is that every time you raise the height, it saves the GPS coordinates of the position where it was raised and the next time, the car will raise the height on its own at that location - very handy and useful. Once you cross 50 km/h, it goes back to its normal ride height. However, above 120 km/h, it drops by 10 mm and above 160 km/h it drops by a further 10 mm. God bless the underbody if you hit a rough patch doing 120 km/h!  \\nThanks to the weight of the battery on the floor, the handling and body control of the EQS are surprisingly good. It\\'s no S-Class in terms of dynamics and this is in a good way. GTO was driving the EQS and we followed him down the Lonavala ghat in his BMW 530D and were amazed to see the cornering speeds it could do and how flat the car was with hardly any lean through the turns even at higher speeds. You can chuck it into bends and not even realise that this is a 2.5 ton barge.  \\nThe best part is the steering. Thanks to the 4-wheel steering system, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheel at slow speeds and in the same direction at speeds above 60 km/h. This means that in sharp corners, you can flick the EQS like a C-Class and as speeds build up, you have more steering control. This also helps in city manoeuvrability as the rear wheels can turn by 10 degrees in the opposite direction as the front. However, Mercedes-Benz is being cheeky here and taking a leaf out of BMW\\'s books. The 10-degree steering is a paid subscription option and you only get 4 degrees as standard. However, as an introductory offer, Mercedes will offer this for free on the first 500 cars sold in India. It\\'s something you realise is needed when taking a U-turn or parking in tight spaces as the turning diameter is just 10.9 m with the 10-degree option, which is lesser than the C-Class and more in the league of compact cars.  \\nThere\\'s no denying the fact that this is a large and heavy car, but with the weight low down and the suspension and steering tech, the EQS is a lot more fun than the luxury S-Class and the E-Class LWB.   Braking \\nAs I drove out of the Chakan plant, I pointed to Vid6639 how the braking wasn\\'t very intuitive and reassuring. At the top of his hat, he attributed that to the regeneration braking feature and the electric servo vs the hydraulic servo in ICE cars. While this was probably the case, the pedal just felt too spongy and vague. With the kind of acceleration the EQS has, the brakes are a letdown. They just don\\'t inspire confidence. However, the braking, when ADAS is on, is very, very strong and much more reassuring than you pressing down on the pedal. As with EVs, the initial braking is taken care of by the regen after which, the disc brakes take over.  \\nThe EQS gets three regeneration braking modes apart from switching off regen completely: \\n1) Normal: This is the normal setting with a mild level of regen\\n2) Strong: This is a very aggressive form of regeneration where taking the foot off the accelerator implies mild/strong braking. In this mode not only do the brake lights turn on when you lift off the throttle, but the brake pedal gets depressed as well!\\n3) Intelligent: This is a mix of Normal / Strong depending on the car\\'s computer deciding when to use what.  \\nAll the regen modes are toggled using the paddle shifters.  \\nThe Intelligent mode is as good as useless as the car keeps toggling between Normal and Strong, which won\\'t give you a good sense of how much you need to brake. With the pedal sometimes moving away from your foot and the system going into Strong regen, you are kept guessing how much braking the car will apply vs how much pedal input is needed. You will land up slowing down too much before a traffic light or speed breaker and sometimes realise that you have to brake manually as the system is in Normal regen.  \\nThe Strong regen mode can be enabled by a flick of the left paddle and is very useful when slowing down in emergency situations or when you are driving aggressively and braking harder intentionally. It\\'s very useful in the ghats before a hairpin bend. \\nIrrespective of all these regen modes, GTO, Vid6639 and myself all were unimpressed with the overall braking. There also should be a regen mode between normal and strong, which would be more useful than the intelligent mode. \\nThe EQS 580 gets the full suite of safety features that are available in the S-Class. This includes Active Steering Assist, 9 Airbags, 360-degree camera, Driving Assistance and more. GTO likes to switch off all these aids and sensors given how ill-suited they are to Indian driving conditions and rightly so. For instance, Automatic Braking / Collision Avoidance can be a huge nuisance and safety hazard (yep, the irony) as you drive in our cities. When you have all sorts of animals and vehicles randomly appearing in front / alongside you, this feature runs you the risk of being rear-ended, given how we don\\'t like to give each other much space.

In this scenario the regen level is maximized such that the vehicle naturally retards away from such a situation which will both regenerate energy as well as reduce braking effort.

Thanks to them for the expert observations!  Introduction \\r\\nLet us tell you one thing straight up = the MG ZS EV is the most sorted electric car sold in India (this side of the luxury marques, of course). It is considerably more expensive than the Nexon EV, yes, but if you can afford it, the price premium is well worth it. The MG ZS EV will make you glee; go for a test-drive and then come back to comment on this thread.  \\r\\nFirst launched in January 2020, the ZS EV has won its share of fans. MG just brought in the facelift you see here and the changes aren\\'t merely cosmetic. The facelift comes with a bigger battery pack with a claimed range of 461 km, a new, more powerful motor that makes 174 BHP & 280 Nm, along with some new features.  MG ZS EV Price & Brochure\\r\\nMG has launched the ZS EV facelift at Rs. 22.00 lakh for the Excite variant (which will be available from July 2022) and Rs. 25.88 lakh for the Exclusive variant. Important to note that the MG Astor - which can be seen as the petrol variant of the ZS EV - is priced from Rs. 9.98 lakh to Rs. 17.73 lakh. Essentially, with the ZS EV, you are paying the premium for electric technology and being an early adopter of the same.  \\r\\nYou can download the MG ZS EV brochure here - MG ZS EV Brochure.pdf  Incentives \\r\\nApart from the central government\\'s incentives, states are offering additional perks to promote the use of electric vehicles. In Maharashtra and Delhi, registration and road tax have been waived off on all EVs. Furthermore, individuals can avail of income tax benefits under section 80EEB (only applicable for vehicles registered by individuals) - click here to read a detailed article on the same.   Running Costs \\r\\nEVs have come to be known for the magical number of \"1 rupee per km\". With the facelift, MG has increased the battery capacity of the ZS EV from 44.5 kWh to 50.3 kWh.  This means it will need 50 units of electricity for a 100% charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it\\x92s about Rs. 8 per unit. This translates to Rs. 400 for a full charge. MG claims a range of 461 km on a full charge and in the real world, if one drives conservatively, 350 (realistic) - 400 km (if you drive like a miser) are obtainable. Thus, the approximate Rs. 1 per km running cost holds true for the ZS EV as well.   Want to know more about EVs?  Be sure to read GTO\\'s excellent article (Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head) on the topic.', 'Exterior   Design & Styling \\r\\nIn most cases, the facelift of a car looks better than the previous version. I\\'m not sure if that\\'s true with the MG ZS EV - you may or may not agree with me. While the car still looks neat overall, the front of the ZS EV is going to polarise opinions for sure. Gone is the Mercedes-like grille with chrome inserts. There is a solid front grille, which is more in line with those seen on electric cars, the bumper has been changed and the headlights have been re-profiled. The face now looks rather stubby. The rear, on the other hand, looks very smart with sleek LED tail-lamps and a new bumper with neatly integrated reflectors.   Build Quality, Fit & Finish \\r\\nThe ZS EV is a well-built car. The panel shut lines are tight and there\\'s not much flex in the body panels. The doors and bonnet have a good amount of heft to them and the car feels sturdy overall.   Wheels & Tyres \\r\\nThe ZS EV is equipped with 17\" alloy wheels that are shod with 215/55 section tyres. Our test car was shod with Michelin Primacy 3 ST rubber. The recommended tyre pressure is a whopping 41 PSI all around, which has been done to maximise the range.  \\r\\nIf you are going to drive it like an enthusiast, you might want to consider wider tyres. The torque on tap is enough to make the tyres slide under hard driving.   Standard & Extended Warranty \\r\\nThe ZS EV is offered with MG e-Shield under which you get a 5 year / unlimited km warranty, 5 years of roadside assistance and 5 labour-free services. Apart from this, you also get an 8 year / 150,000 km warranty on the battery.   Safety \\r\\nThe ZS EV gets a host of safety features like 6 airbags, electronic stability control, ABS + EBD + Brake Assist, emergency stop signal, hill start assist, hill descent control, electronic parking brake with auto hold, ISOFIX child seat anchors, tyre pressure monitoring system and all-round disc brakes. Additionally, you get a 360-degree camera, rear-drive assist (blind-spot detection system, rear cross-traffic alert & lane change assist), heated ORVMs and pedestrian warning system.  \\r\\nThe pre-facelift version got a 5-star rating at the Euro NCAP, and we\\'re sure that this facelift will perform similarly. MG better not have made any \"India specific\" or localization changes (which is industry speak for cheapening the product).', 'Interior   Cabin Design & Quality \\r\\nIf you\\'ve been in the pre-facelift car, you\\'ll appreciate how MG has cleverly improved the cabin. For starters, there\\'s an additional soft leather insert running across the dashboard with a carbon-fibre finish and contrast red stitching that looks / feels brilliant. Plenty of soft-touch elements give the cabin a premium feel. The lower part of the dashboard has hard plastics, but of good quality. Overall, the interiors feel solid and well built, although they don\\'t have that \"wow\" factor of the Astor\\'s red cabin.  \\r\\nIn terms of design, the dashboard and centre console look uncluttered, thanks to the absence of a conventional gear lever and the use of an electronic parking brake.     Space & Comfort \\r\\nThere\\'s a fair amount of space available. The big leather front seats are super comfy and accommodating. The cushioning is slightly on the softer side. They offer good under-thigh and side support to keep you in place on twisty roads.   Driving Position & Ergonomics \\r\\nGetting comfortable in the driver\\'s seat is easy with the ZS EV. The flat-bottom steering wheel is carried over from the earlier car and is lovely to hold. Feels very German. Sadly, it\\'s adjustable only for height and not reach! The driver\\'s seat is 6-way power-adjustable with a healthy range. Hence, finding your perfect driving position shouldn\\'t be a problem. The frontal visibility is good and you get a good view of the road while driving. All the controls are where you\\'d expect them to be and are easily reachable.  Cabin Storage \\r\\nThe absence of a handbrake and traditional gear lever has freed up a lot of space in the centre console. There are the usual cupholders, a storage bin under the centre armrest and a spot with a wireless charging pad for keeping your smartphone. Apart from this, all the door pockets are deep and can hold a 1-litre bottle, along with some other knick-knacks. The glovebox is average-sized. We wish it were more spacious. There are two cupholders in the new centre armrest for rear passengers to use.   Air-Conditioning \\r\\nIn the hot and humid weather of Mumbai, the ZS EV\\'s air-con performed very well. There\\'s a noticeable drop in the performance of the air-con while driving in ECO mode though. The system gets a PM 2.5 filter, which in today\\'s day and age is a necessity in the metro cities.   Features Unique & Noteworthy Features \\r\\nMG is known to pack its cars with features and the ZS EV is no different. You get a 7\" fully digital instrument cluster, a panoramic sunroof, auto headlamps, auto wipers, a 360-degree camera (mediocre display quality), heated ORVMs, drive modes, rear-drive assist features and i-Smart connected car features. What the ZS EV misses out on is an auto-dimming IRVM, ventilated seats and wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto. We would have also liked it if MG offered the adaptive cruise control system from the Astor.   Audio System & Sound Quality \\r\\nThe 10\" infotainment system, like before, has a simple and user-friendly interface. You will get used to it in no time. The display is crisp with a good contrast of colours and even under direct sunlight, visibility is good. The 6-speaker (4 speakers + 2 tweeters) sound system just about makes the cut. In terms of sound quality, there\\'s nothing to write home about for the 25-lakh price.     Rear Passengers   Rear Seat Comfort & Space \\r\\nThe ZS EV isn\\'t as low as a hatchback nor is it as high as some of the conventional SUVs. So, getting in and out is an easy affair. You slide in and out of the rear seats with ease. You get 3 soft, adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers. But it\\'s really just better if the third occupant is a child and not an adult.  \\r\\nThere\\'s a decent amount of knee room and headroom for rear passengers. At 5\\'10\", I could sit behind my driving position with some knee room to spare. I\\'d have felt more comfortable with a little more under-thigh support though. Shorter people will find the under-thigh support comfortable, but taller occupants will find it lacking. New to the facelift is the rear centre armrest, which is wide and also houses 2 cup holders. Rear passengers get air-con vents, a regular USB port and a Type-C USB port.     Boot Space \\r\\nThe boot is large enough to carry a family\\'s weekend luggage. The 60:40 split rear seats can be folded down to increase cargo space.', 'Driving the MG ZS EV\\r\\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor puts out 174 BHP & 280 Nm of torque. Compared to the previous car, the facelift makes 33 BHP more, but 73 Nm less! It\\'s still as quick though:  \\r\\nBefore we get to the driving part, let\\x92s get the basics right. There are 3 main components in an EV \\x96 the battery, the motor and the controller/charger. The battery is what stores the energy and the motor is what uses that energy to move the car. The controller/charger converts the energy from the battery into a usable form to power the motor. In more technical terms, the power grid from your house or a charging station is usually an AC. The lithium-ion battery can store electric energy in DC form. So while charging, there\\x92s usually an AC/DC converter that will convert the power grid\\'s AC into DC and store it in the car\\x92s battery. The DC fast chargers that you see, usually have the AC/DC converter inbuilt, which is how they can charge the car\\x92s battery faster. The controller typically sits on top of the motor.  \\r\\nDriving an EV is quite a unique experience and recent EVs have all been impressive. Push the engine start button with your foot on the brake pedal and you\\'ll hear nothing, although the car is \"alive\" now. There are four transmission modes to choose from \\x96 P, D, R and N. Turn the classy rotary dial to engage D, lift your foot off the brake pedal and the car crawls forward at 6 km/h. This will be highly appreciated in heavy traffic conditions where you can drive with just the brake pedal. I had the privilege of getting stuck in Mumbai\\'s Western Express Highway weekend traffic for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it wasn\\'t that bad crawling in the bumper-to-bumper traffic.  \\r\\nDriving in the city is a pleasant experience. The accelerator pedal\\'s response is linear and not snappy (especially in Eco mode). Passengers will appreciate how smooth the drive feels, without any jerks caused by gearshifts or any engine sounds. It is an incredibly refined experience.  \\r\\nGet on some open city roads, floor the A pedal and you\\'ll be greeted with instant power / acceleration. This is the beauty of powerful electric motors. The car is fast and has abundant torque right from the get-go. In fact, the acceleration is so strong that, in all of the silly childish drag races at traffic lights, you will always win. MG claims a 0-100 km/h time of 8.5 seconds (same as the previous car) and we believe that. To put that timing in perspective, the ZS EV is faster than the Creta, Seltos, Astor etc., but not something like the Octavia which is 0.5 seconds quicker to 100. The MG ZS EV is genuinely enjoyable to drive and anyone who experiences the effortless acceleration the first time becomes an instant convert.  \\r\\nOne key difference compared to the outgoing car is that the traction control cannot be switched off manually. While in the old car, you could switch it off and leave tyre marks on the road, in the new car, the traction control gives you a perfect launch without the unnecessary wheelspin. On the move, you will not only be keeping up with traffic, but flying past other unsuspecting cars in no time (in stealth mode ) quite easily. Overall, despite the lesser torque and more power, the refreshed ZS EV feels very similar to the outgoing car in terms of performance.  \\r\\nOut on the highway, the ZS EV is fantastic. An advantage of a powerful electric motor is, if you need to perform a quick overtake, there\\'s no need to wait for a downshift or being in the engine\\'s powerband. Just bury the accelerator pedal and you\\'re off! You\\'ll hit silly speeds with ease, and not even realise it due to the lack of drama (engine noise etc.). That being said, single-gear EVs don\\'t have that higher end punch above 120 - 140 km/h that geared turbo-petrol cars do. Keep in mind that if you drive hard, the range drops drastically. This is also why you will see EVs that are driving longer distances sticking to the middle lane and cruising at 80-100 km/h (which is the best cruising speed for the current lots of EVs). We already told you that the ZS EV has a realistic range of 350 - 400 km. But with an aggressive pedal-to-the-metal driving style, GTO used up about 70% of the battery after just 135 km of hard driving. Again, EVs are best at cruising @ 80-100 km/h for long-distance travel. This sensitivity to driving style is more like turbo-petrols rather than turbo-diesels which are more forgiving.  \\r\\nGetting up to cruising speeds is an easy affair and the absence of any sound means you will reach triple-digit speeds without realising it (it\\'s only when the speed warning chimes sound that you know you\\'re doing 80 km/h and 120 km/h). The MID shows the motor spinning at 7,600 rpm while doing 100 km/h and 9,000 rpm at 120 km/h. If you\\'re wondering, \"isn\\'t this too high?\", well, most electric motors are high revving and can rev to over 20,000 rpm! This eliminates the need to use complicated gearboxes. The entire usable powerband can be achieved with a single-speed transmission, although higher-end cars like the Porsche Taycan have adopted a second gear.  \\r\\nThere are 3 driving modes to choose from and unlike some other cars, these aren\\'t gimmicky. They\\'re mapped specifically for different driving styles.  \\r\\n\\x95 Normal Mode: The default mode. The car always restarts in this mode, no matter what mode you last drove in. It\\'s great for driving in the city as well as on the highway. Strikes a good balance between power and economy.  \\r\\n\\x95 Eco Mode: The mode to engage when you want the maximum range. Throttle response is dumbed down, which actually results in a smoother drive in the city (less of that \"torque-pull\" effect). Power comes in more gradually when you ask for it. However, even in this mode, the motor does not feel dull to drive. There\\'s enough grunt for day-to-day driving and overtaking. The performance of the air-con, however, drops noticeably in this mode.  \\r\\n\\x95 Sport Mode: The mode when you really want to have fun. While Normal mode will keep you entertained 90% of the time, Sport mode is for the remaining 10%. The accelerator response is even sharper and the car just feels more eager to pounce. However, it can feel too peaky for city driving and also eats up the battery faster. Use \"Sport\" when you\\'re looking for fun on expressway runs.   Regenerative Braking  \\r\\nThere are 3 levels of regenerative braking, just like in the previous car. At levels 1 and 2, there\\'s obviously lesser resistance when you lift off the accelerator pedal. I found myself driving mostly on level 3 with maximum regeneration. Interestingly, even at level 3, the regenerative braking didn\\'t really seem as strong as in the Hyundai Kona. It\\'s slightly more subdued, but still works well and feels more natural for someone coming from a petrol / diesel-powered car. Engine braking lovers will appreciate driving with regen at the maximum level. But MG should really have made level 3 stronger.   Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) \\r\\nNo engine, no sound, no gearshifts! The ZS EV is eerily silent on the inside as well as the outside. So, you will find yourself honking at pedestrians who\\'re simply unaware of the car creeping up behind them. A faint whine from the motor is heard only at high revs, which is beyond 100 km/h and that too isn\\'t intrusive. On the highway, tyre noise and wind noise register themselves beyond 100 km/h.   Range \\r\\nMG claims a range of 461 km with the new 50.3 kWh battery pack based on ICAT certification. The new battery pack is the largest in the segment and gets ASIL-D, IP69K safety ratings, which are by today\\'s standards the highest for electric cars. It gets a UL 2580 certification, which just means that it has been tested to meet nationally-recognized safety standards. \\r\\nThe outgoing car had a 44.5 kWh battery pack and its ARAI certified range was 340 km. In all fairness, these numbers are very subjective and the real-life range solely depends on how you drive the car. Check out this excellent report by BHPian docelectric2020 where he took the ZS EV on a 1,200 km road trip. You should expect 350 - 400 km, depending on how you push the magic pedal.  \\r\\nGiven the rising demand for EVs, there are plenty of charging stations popping up everywhere, which ought to take care of range anxiety. There are many apps and websites like pulseenergy.io, plugshare.com, etc. that list out all the charging stations near you. End of the day though, remember the golden rule = EVs are best charged where they are parked (either at your office or home).   Charging \\r\\nThe ZS EV gets the industry-standard CCS type-2 charging port. You get a 7.4 kW home charger from MG installed in your parking lot that can charge the battery from 0-100% in 8.5 to 9 hours. If you\\'re travelling somewhere, you can use the portable charger in the boot to charge the car from any 15 Amp socket (the larger 3-pin sockets used for ACs and fridges), which would take about 15-19 hours to charge from 0-100%. Do note that in all EVs, the initial 0 - 80% charging happens quicker...the final 81 - 100% takes more time. The last option are the 50 kW DC fast chargers that you will find at some of the charging stations. This would fill up your car\\'s battery from 0-80% in about 60 minutes. If you\\'re still worried about getting stuck somewhere after running out of juice, MG has roadside assistance with mobile charging support currently available in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pune. \\r\\nThe charging socket is placed under a simple flap on the front solid grille. There\\'s a green indicator next to the socket showing the battery level. The pre-facelift car had a unique charging flap where the MG logo would move up and you had to insert the charging cable below. The MG logo even lit up when the car was charging (reference image). IMO, that arrangement looked way cooler than this simple open flap and charge mechanism:  \\r\\nOnce plugged in, the MID displays the remaining charging time, estimated range and battery percentage: ', 'Suspension   Ride Comfort \\r\\nEVs are inherently heavy cars due to the battery pack in the middle. Getting the right balance of ride & handling is tricky and it\\'s especially the case with EVs based on ICE cars (like the ZS EV). The ZS EV gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam suspension at the rear. It rides on 17\" alloy wheels that are shod with 215/55 section tyres. The recommended tyre pressure is a (very high) 41 PSI, presumably to maximise the driving range. With this tyre pressure, the suspension is firm and you are always aware of the kind of road you\\'re travelling on. That said, the ride quality isn\\'t as bone-jarringly stiff as the Kona. It\\'s liveable, although you will slow down for bad roads.  \\r\\nWe dropped the pressure down to 35 PSI, which made the ride more absorbent & compliant. With this more reasonable tyre pressure level, bumpy roads were handled in a better manner (although the underlying firmness was there).    Handling & Dynamics \\r\\nThe ZS EV\\'s straight-line stability is good and the car doesn\\'t feel nervous even at 120 km/h. However, if there are undulations on the road, the car does tend to feel bouncy. The handling is above average. Drive it like a family man and you\\'ll find the behaviour to be neutral. Drive it like an enthusiast and you\\'ll feel body roll, with understeer coming in earlier than expected. The ZS EV isn\\'t a car that likes being hustled through corners & these tyres can\\'t handle all that sudden torque in the turns either. We recommend a more conservative driving style on your favourite mountain roads.   Steering \\r\\nThe electric power steering is a nice unit and very user-friendly. It\\'s light at slow speeds which makes driving around the city a breeze. The EPS weighs up adequately on the highways.   Braking \\r\\nThe all-wheel disc brake setup provides good stopping power. Emergency braking situations are handled well and the car is brought to a halt from high speeds effectively.', '2022 MG ZS EV Facelift Exterior Images\\r\\nNo more Mercedes-like chrome studded grille on the ZS EV.

It looks smart and clean, although the design\\'s age does show:  \\r\\nProportionate side profile:  \\r\\nMake no mistake, this is the best \"mainstream\" electric car sold in India today:  \\r\\nThe ZS EV feels well built with uniform panel gaps. It\\'s offered in four shades - Currant Red (our test car), Ashen Silver, Sable Black and Ferris White. The nice Copenhagen Blue paint shade of the pre-facelift car has not been carried over:  \\r\\nHalogen projector headlamps have been replaced by sharper LED headlamps with integrated LED DRLs. Notice the nice crystal-like detailing on the inside:  \\r\\nWide air dam at the bottom gets a slot in the middle for ADAS tech. It\\'s a dummy for now (ZS EV doesn\\'t get ADAS):  \\r\\nSlats on the sides direct air towards wheel wells (and brakes?). Subtle chrome insert gels well with the design:  \\r\\nFull underbody protection :  \\r\\nLooks very Tesla Model 3-like in this image. Bonnet gets two prominent creases running down towards the grille:  \\r\\nORVMs get integrated turn-indicators. Side cameras for the 360-degree view are mounted below:  \\r\\nBoth front door handles get chrome request sensors. Don\\'t miss the chrome insert on the top:  \\r\\nThough the window line rises towards the rear, the glass area is adequate:  \\r\\nRedesigned 17\" alloy wheels are claimed to be more aerodynamic. They sure look the part! Shod with 215/55 section Michelin Primacy tyres (pre-facelift car had 215/50 section tyres):  \\r\\nGood to see MG offering disc brakes all-round:  \\r\\nThe panoramic sunroof will win your family over:  \\r\\nRestyled all-LED tail-lamps look sharp:  \\r\\nRedesigned rear bumper has a diffuser-like design with chrome detailing:  \\r\\nRear fog lamps and reflectors get piano black housings with honeycomb mesh grilles:  \\r\\nLike in the pre-facelift, the tailgate badge doubles up as the handle. However, it\\'s finished in the body colour now: ', '2022 MG ZS EV Facelift Interior Images\\r\\nInterior largely resembles the pre-facelift car\\'s, with a few feature additions and design changes. It looks clean and feels premium too:  \\r\\nFlat-bottom steering wheel is a delight to hold. Thumb contours are perfectly placed and design details like the perforated leather & contrast red stitching give it a sporty look. It\\'s adjustable for height, but not reach - quite sad in such an expensive model:  \\r\\nTelephony controls on the LHS and buttons for MID operation + voice assist button on the RHS:  \\r\\nOn the left, you have the light/indicator stalk and on the right is the wiper stalk. The ZS EV is equipped with auto headlamps and auto wipers. The quality of these stalks isn\\'t befitting the car\\'s hefty price tag:  \\r\\nCruise control is located below the light stalk:  \\r\\nEngine start button gets a nice chrome ring around it:  \\r\\nNew fully-digital instrument cluster has a \"power meter\" on the right. There\\'s plenty of information being displayed on the 7\" screen in the middle:  \\r\\nBattery percentage is displayed at the bottom right corner and drive modes are in the bottom left. Range is shown below the drive mode and next to it is the transmission mode. Note how much the indicated range drops in Normal and Sport modes:  \\r\\nShift to P and the MID reminds you to power \\'OFF\\' the car before leaving. You also get live animation of power flow (from the battery to motor and back) while driving. Motor speed, voltage and current are shown on the MID - something to look forward to in EVs henceforth. The ZS EV does get a tyre pressure monitoring system. See the icon with number \"3\" next to the battery %? That is the selectable regen level:   \\r\\nRound AC vents have a brushed silver border that looks nice:  \\r\\nDoorpads carry forward the all-black theme of the dashboard. They can hold 1-litre bottles and some other knick-knacks. Soft armrest feels good to use and carbon-fibre finish leather insert above the armrest feels premium:  \\r\\nVery accommodating front seats are wide and supportive. Driver\\'s seat is 6-way power-adjustable, but without lumbar adjustment. We also wish MG would\\'ve offered ventilated seats at this price point:  \\r\\nWell-spaced A and B pedals along with a very usable dead pedal:  \\r\\nSeatbelts are not adjustable for height, but they are placed at a comfortable level for most users:  \\r\\nHeated ORVMs are of a healthy size and coverage area is fair:  \\r\\nAs part of the rear driver-assist features, you have blind spot detection, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert. Whenever the system detects a car in the blind spot, the warning on the respective ORVM starts blinking. Pretty neat:  \\r\\nIRVM is decently sized. However, the headrests obstruct the view a bit:  \\r\\nAlso, just like the previous car, no auto-dimming IRVM!  \\r\\nRearward visibility from the driver\\'s seat is satisfactory, but the thick C-pillars create a blind spot. The quarter glasses do make things slightly better:  \\r\\nCentre fascia is tilted towards the driver:  \\r\\n10\" touchscreen is a very user-friendly unit. The display has a nice colour contrast with good readability, even under direct sunlight:  \\r\\nHome screen is split with various functions like the weather, AC controls, battery status and media. Other options are listed on the right for you to choose from. Various vehicle functions can be accessed through the settings menu, such as the follow-me-home headlamps function, hill descent control, pedestrian alert and rear-drive assist functions. AC controls can be operated via the touchscreen as well (nice graphics!). The display for the 360-degree camera is very poor. You can switch between a 2D view and 3D view of the car for better judgement of a curb or other obstacles:  \\r\\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity has been provided, albeit not wireless. Pressing the battery button (on the centre console above the transmission mode selector) brings up the screen showing the range and other battery information. You can scroll to see how much carbon dioxide you have saved! Also find the nearest charging station with the onboard navigation:  \\r\\nJust below the touchscreen are the controls for the climate control system. Interestingly, the buttons for adjusting the volume of the sound system & accessing the home screen have been placed here too. Good from the usability POV:  \\r\\nAt the base of the centre fascia, there\\'s a wireless charging pad along with a 12V socket and Type-C / Type-A USB ports:  \\r\\nCentre console gets a grab handle for the front passenger. Those experiencing an EV\\'s instant torque the first time might find it handy:  \\r\\nClassy gear mode selector has been carried over from the previous car. Pressing the round knob engages \\'P\\'. There are three switches on the top for the drive mode selection, regenerative braking level and battery status:  \\r\\nBelow, you have the electronic parking brake and auto-hold switch with black faux wood around them. Two cupholders have been provided:  \\r\\nThey get a sliding cover:   \\r\\nBeneath the centre armrest is a useable storage compartment, although its floor area is narrow:  \\r\\nA closer look at the carbon-fibre finish leather insert on the dashboard with the contrast red stitching. Very sporty!  \\r\\nThe glovebox is just about average in size. It does not get cooling or illumination:  \\r\\nNew sunroof control panel. The earlier one had a round knob for the operation of the sunroof & sunshade:  \\r\\nLarge panoramic sunroof allows plenty of light inside the cabin to make it feel bright and airy:  \\r\\nRear doorpads have an identical theme to the front ones. They can carry 1-litre bottles along with some other stuff:  \\r\\nGetting in and out of the rear seat is an easy affair. The seats are set at the perfect height for you to easily slide into them. Once in, there\\'s a decent amount of knee room and headroom for someone of my height (5\\'10\"):  \\r\\nBehind my own driving position, I had enough knee room to be comfortable. With the front seat pushed back, my knees touch the seatback:  \\r\\nThree 3-point seatbelts as well as three adjustable headrests have been provided, but the rear seat is better suited for 2 adults and a kid (rather than 3 healthy adults). If it is two overweight adults, even a kid cannot be accommodated. Also, the middle portion of the backrest protrudes (due to the armrest) and the seat base is elevated in the centre:  \\r\\nCentre armrest is soft and wide enough for both rear passengers to rest their arms on. It gets two cupholders:  \\r\\nAC vents for rear passengers. Type-A and Type-C USB charging ports are located just below. A piano black insert around these would\\'ve looked nice:  \\r\\nBig parcel tray gets a prominent border to keep items placed on it from rolling onto the rear seat:  \\r\\nThanks to BHPian Arnav612 for sharing this information. The size of the boot has decreased as the spare wheel is now a full-size piece (the outgoing car came with a space saver). Still, the space available is adequate to carry a family\\'s weekend luggage. Folding the rear seat down gives you more cargo capacity:  \\r\\nSpare is now a full-size steel wheel, a most welcome move as space-savers come with 80 kmph speed restrictions. Tyre changing kit and tow hook are arranged nicely in a Styrofoam casing: ', 'We have some really good EVs on sale in India now with the Tigor, Nexon & ZS electrics, but it\\'s the MG that\\'s the best relatively affordable one. China went all out on EVs & SAIC (MG\\'s parent) has been building thousands of them for a while now...that experience shows in just how \"sorted\" the ZS EV feels.

I have not installed the 7KW charger and have been happily making do with the slow charger that plugs into any 15A plug. If you plug it in at night, say around 9pm, you would get around 60% to 70 charge done by the morning. Normally one does not charge from zero and should charge till about 80% for battery health. Hence if you plug it in at 20 to 30% charge remaining, you will be at 80% by the morning even with the slow charger. Unless you need to drive 300  kms daily and don\\'t have the time to charge overnight, the faster 7KW charger is not needed. You can contact me after you receive the ZS and I can help you sell the 7KW charger if you want to do so.

I have been charging my ZS using the slow charger without any issues. Normally I put it to charge at around 25 to 30%. I charge to 80% for battery health.  So I need around 10 hours on the slow charger. Plugging in at night, you can easily get 12 hours of charge by the morning which is equivalent to a 60% top up. Unless you are going on a long trip and need a 100% charge, this works really well. When I have a long trip coming up, I simply plug in at around 5pm and I am ready to go by the morning. You can also stop by a fast charger for 30 minutes once in while if there is some urgency but I have never needed to do this.  \\nYou can easily sell your MG provided 7KW charger on various forums.

Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by GTO   Thank you for putting up your first-hand experience . It\\'s what I have been saying from the start. 95% of car owners do NOT need anything more than the regular 15A plug. Reasons: \\n- Your car is anyway parked overnight for 8 - 12 hours. That is more than enough to charge your battery to a level that will exceed your daily commuting requirements. Heck, in most cases, a 10 hour charge on a 15A plug will give you enough juice for 4 - 5 days.  \\n- No one will wait till 0% to charge an EV. Assuming you plug it in at 30%, you will easily be at 80% (or more) by the morning.  \\n- Even with a 15A plug, the typical commuter won\\'t need to charge more than once or twice a week.  \\n- Plugging in isn\\'t a hassle at all. In fact, its more convenient than going to the petrol pump. My cars are on trickle chargers and it\\'s way more effort to plug the trickle chargers in than an EV. I have to remove the Bosch C7 from the boot, open the bonnet, place the Bosch C7 carefully, connect the positive & negative terminals, then route the power cord through a gap, plug it into a wall, power up and close the bonnet. Sometimes, I have to manually choose the mode too (AGM vs regular 12v). Repeat exercise in reverse when I have to drive away, and repeat in the same order when I return. In comparison, the ZS EV I had recently was a breeze to plug in.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe perfect city car:  \\nOn the open road, that instant torque means you can keep up with far more expensive machinery. EVs will democratize performance. You could never get a 0-100 7 to 8 second petrol car under 12 lakhs before, but you will with EVs. Watch this space:  \\nPeople driving a ZS EV for the first time become instant converts. My brother-in-law now wants to buy an EV next...  \\n...as do my bhabhi & nephew.

However, for majority of EV buyers, it would be their second or third car, and this is when the high price tag of the ZS plays spoilsport. In this scenario, the Nexon EV (despite all its quirks and QC issues) appears as a much more viable option for Indian middle class car buyers.

The cost of buying a fast EV charger is just around 60k to 70k today. Compare this with how much it costs to set up a petrol station which easily runs into crores. Even with low utilization, EV chargers can easily break even. This is the reason why you see a massive increase in the number of chargers in India. Just open Plugshare and Tata Power to see the number of chargers. Given that setting up EV chargers has been delicensed, I expect that within the next 24 months, all major highways to be electrified because most restaurants will gain high-value captive customers. This is already true in most parts of TN because of Zeon. \\r\\nAccording to British Petroleum, their EV chargers are about to overtake their fuel pumps in profitability: Link   \\r\\n2. Batteries even after a decade of use, contain a lot of rare earth which are very valuable. So it makes it extremely lucrative to recycle them.

There is no way people will dump such valuable batteries when so much money can be made out of them.Link \\r\\n3. For EVs there is not much in terms of maintainence.

Personally, for me, I would need a few breaks on a 500 plus km journey and charging won\\x92t be an issue.\\r\\nBattery swapping is not a workable idea at all. Would you be ok with swapping your 12 plus lakh battery that is at a 100% SOH (state of health) with an unknown one which might have 20% degradation? What if your battery is only a few months old but the swapped one is 5 years old? This only works with fleets like taxis which run in a small pre determined area. In addition, setting up a charger is easy and cheap. Any hotel, restaurant, rest area or business can easily do so. So you would have thousands of options. If you were limited to swapping, there would be very few stations in some limited areas. Then there are all kinds of problems that would crop up. Imagine a power failure in the middle of the swapping process or some other complication. Would there be trained mechanics available 24/7 to handle this? The area required, the equipment and the cost is far more than a simple charger. Now with chargers available at rates as high as 350KW, you can charge a vehicle in 10 minutes. So swapping is a complete non starter. Some companies might try it by selling a cheaper vehicle with battery as a service concept where you won\\x92t own or pay for the battery. It might work in commercial vehicles and some basic budget EVs. It won\\x92t work for normal personal use. A taxi driver doesn\\x92t want to spend an hour out of this 10 hour shift on charging each day.

So instead of repeating all the hits and misses, I have focused on my initial ownership experience and observations. I got this car in April and I am enjoying it so far.  I was instantly attracted on the first ride. Her sophistication, elegance and energy had me smitten. I had to woo her a lot because there were so many suitors. She tested my patience but finally after several months she moved in with me. Now I have gotten to know her personality better and the initial attraction has metamorphosed into deep admiration.   The first few weeks revealed her quirks. I quickly found out that she hates heat. Her efficiency drops rapidly and so I try to keep her in the shade. She also doesn't like to be pushed to the limit and prefers smooth sailing. She has a weird accent and so we keep our verbal dialogue to a minimum. After several efforts I was also able to convince her not to start the radio every morning.   She is like an exotic beauty and yet extremely low maintenance. Her best aspect is the poise with which she carries herself even while hustling. There is no melodrama instead just peace and comfort. At the start I thought she was strictly a city gal but it seems she doesn't mind a short weekend getaway. She was surprisingly fun and energetic on our recent trip. We both know that she is a sprinter and not a marathoner. So she doesn't mind me occasionally riding with other gals who prefer cross country trips. She knows I will come back to her. She is also very charismatic and has charmed my family and friends. She is unique and the easiest to live with compared to all my previous partners. \\nThese are still early days but so far I love this car for its refinement, comfort, acceleration and technology. \\n  Following are the things I have done and recommend to prospective owners:If possible install the 7kW      charger because it has all the advantages of slow charging at thrice the      speed. When you are back late in night and need to head out early the next      day you will appreciate the charging speed. Set the regeneration to      highest and push through the change. I felt motion sick for the first few      days because my body was expecting coasting instead of deceleration. But      now I love not having to use the brakes so much so that I long for      stronger regeneration. I got a ventilated seat      cover powered by a 12V socket. This not only prevents sweaty backsides but      also increases range because the AC doesn\\x92t have to work very hard. I bought a dongle to convert      wired android auto to wireless According to my research this car most likely has a LFP battery (not confirmed officially) that is actively cooled. This chemistry is very      resilient to high charging/discharging so don\\x92t fret about charging to      100% or going down to 20%. On the contrary it needs to charge to full to      get a good estimate of SOC (state of charge). Do your own research before      buying the car and if you are still risk averse to this new technology      stay clear of EVs. But after you have pulled the trigger enjoy the car      without worrying about battery degradation. Personally this car fit my      requirements so well compared to anything else on the market that I am      okay to be an early adopter (probably early majority) of this relatively      new technology. I believe that the car will remain usable in the city for      a very long time. Other things of interest that I have noticed:As I mentioned before this      car isn\\x92t efficient in heat. If the car is parked in direct sun than in      44° afternoons I notice the efficiency drop to 4.5-5km/KWH and it      increases to 6.5-7km/KWH in 35° evenings. On a relaxed night drives I see      the efficiency rise above 8km/KWH. I am not a sedate driver and I      consistently got an effective range of around 300-320kms in the hottest      month of the year with ambient temperatures soaring above 42°. All of these      observations are with the car in the Normal drive mode and the regeneration      set to the highest (the car defaults to these settings on every start). The regeneration      unfortunately goes away and the efficiency is the least when SOC is above      95%. Eco mode lightens the      steering, dampens the throttle response and the AC to give about 10-15%      boost in efficiency. Full power is still available with heavier throttle      when needed. I would probably use this mode in cooler monsoons and      winters. Compared to a hatch or a      sedan the ride is firmer at low speeds. One can carry more speed over bad      roads and it actually improves the ride. I like the heft of the      steering which is unlike other light modern steering wheels. Also many      controls feel similar to past VAG cars I have come to appreciate      all the technology which I initially didn\\x92t care much about. The image      quality from the 360 camera should have been better. Even so with dynamic      guidelines it surely eases getting in and out of my tight parking spot at      work or on a tight ramp. The blind spot detection light in the ORVMs is a      great touch. The alerts are overcautious so I look over my shoulder only      when the light isn\\x92t blinking. The rear cross traffic alert is very      helpful when backing out of certain parking zones. The glass roof is a hit with      rear passengers and the rear AC vents keeps everyone cool Purchase decision\\n This thankfully ended my passionate and painful car search journey of 2 years. This car replaces my 10 year old Polo for my daily city commutes of about 40 odd kilometres. I tried all the turbo petrol automatic crossovers from the Duster to the Compass and all had some deal breakers. Most suffered from the turbo lag and felt slow to respond to my throttle inputs when I wanted sudden bursts of acceleration at low speeds. I was finally convinced with the Octavia even though it\\x92s a bit too big for my needs. I have seen enough Skoda breakdowns in my family past 60000 kilometres to not trust the brand with high mileage use cases. But the Octavia seemed like the only car that would make me happy and so I had prepared myself to pamper the car including its DSG gearbox, light suede seats and the turbo petrol engine. I also braced myself for the high running and maintenance costs. While waiting for discounts on the Octavia, I test drove the ZS EV and found it impressive. I never thought I would get an EV in 2022 much less so with a relatively new brand. The exclusive (top) trim surely seems expensive by 2-3 lakhs but then so is everything else that I liked in these times of supply shortages. The MG sales and service experience have been very good so far. They have cordially attended to my several unusual requests pre and post sales. \\nAmong all the cars that I test drove I felt that under 30 lakhs the Compass is a solid touring car, the Octavia is an elegant all-rounder and the ZS EV is a brilliant city car. If one needs a silent, comfortable and a quick automatic city car this one should be on the shortlist. \\n I have been lucky in terms of ownership experiences with all my past cars and I anticipate this one will build special memories too.\", '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by NT56   I corroborate with all the things mentioned in the official review.

A lithium battery can give out lot of amps, even at low SOC. As long as it doesn't trigger the low voltage cut off or some other limp mode threshold voltage, the air conditioner should run fine with or without charging. \\nAnother example, let's say you are gaming in your phone, If you slow charge with a regular usb 2.0 port. The battery level may stay the same because all the power from the USB 2.0 port 2.5w max is being used by the phone cpu/gpu.

My booking was done on 7th Feb 2022 in MG Noida. \\r\\nHere are my first impressions:The drive experience is simply amazing. Apart from the high acceleration and silence that you would expect from an EV, the handling and suspension is also quite good. Normal seems to be the best mode to drive in. The AC performance takes a huge dip on switching to Eco, and Sport drains battery like anything. So Normal Mode seems best, at least in the scorching heat of Delhi. KERS Level 3 takes a lot of time to get used to. The deceleration on leaving the accelerator pedal is too high to be not noticed.

They didn\\x92t even put a back button in the entire UI. Under thigh support is lacking in the rear seat. I expected it to be better. The front seats, on the other hand, are too comfortable. The quality of leatherite in the interior is really good and gives a complete luxurious feel. The Sunshade is very thin, and there is significant sunlight coming in even on closing the shade. But I doubt they could have done much here considering that the shade has to not just go back and rather crumble in a roll due to the length of the shade. All in all, the pan atomic sunroof enhances the driving experience significantly. I found it a little weird that the data of KMs run, etc. can be reset whenever you want. You can reset both trip and overall data, which seems odd to me. The most absurd design flaw in the car is that you cannot raise the wipers. I tried doing this and it stuck in the edge of the bonnet, scraping some paint as well. You have to go through a lengthy procedure of putting the wipers in service mode to be able to raise them. The entire charade is blantaly senseless and unnecessary.  \\r\\nWill post more about my impressions of the car in my coming days. \\r\\nThe car doesn\\x92t start charging until you lock it.

I would like to tell this especially to those of you who would be driving an EV for the first time.  The range changes drastically based on your driving style. \\nIn the first leg of my journey, I drove for 203 km with 64% battery, which extrapolates to 317 km of range. During this trip, there was heavy traffic ok the highway and I could hardly go above 90 kmph. Mostly the car drove between 60-80 kmph.  \\nIn the second leg, I drove 210 km with 82% battery, which extrapolates to 256 km of range. This time the road was fairly empty and the car drove consistently in 80-100 kmph range, touching 120 kmph at times. The temperatures also increased, so I think the AC also sucked up more energy.  \\nI was driving in Normal mode and KERS 3 in both scenarios.  \\nSo I would recommend you to plan your trips with stoppages no later than ~200 km if you want peace of mind. And don't worry about wasting a lot of time. The charging is very quick till 80% SOC. You can easily charge 0-80% in 35-40 mins on 50 kW charger. The last 20% takes a lot of time, which you can avoid, if you plan stops properly.  \\nAnd if you really have to plan long legs in the journey, be really soft on pedal, avoid aggresive overtakes, stick to 60-80 kmph, and switch to Eco mode if weather permits. The only reason I could not stick to Eco was that the AC practically becomes useless in the current weather of North India.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by siddharthgarg   So I took a long road trip using my ZS EV.  \\r\\nSo I would recommend you to plan your trips with stoppages no later than ~200 km if you want peace of mind.

So this definitely was not the network range issue. Since these were not some \"must work\" features for me, I thought I will visit the workshop later. After 7 days, these features suddenly started working on their own only to stop working again after a week or so. I also noticed one more issue that when I started my car, the SoC showed 14% on head unit whereas actual range was around 71% (which was displayed correctly in Instrument Cluster). This corrects itself after driving a few kms. The same issue was observed 3-4 times where the SoC will always show 14%. This time I took my car to workshop and the SA told me that couple of owners have reported the 14% SoC issue for 2022 model. They also checked the connected features issue and came to a conclusion that the T-box is going in sleep mode. They did system reset and the issue was resolved. SA spoke to technical folks from plant or head office and said that it\\'s a bug in the 2022 model software and will require a month to fix. Until then these issues may reoccur.

My daily running in city includes morning drive of about 35 kms and evening drive of 25 kms.   During morning, there is hardly any traffic and can drive peacefully without much hard stops and accelerations. Evening drive is mostly traffic jams and lot of signals. I am charging the vehicle once in a week (mostly on Friday), after driving around 300-320 kms and still with 10 % SOC remaining. So thermionically consistently getting around 350kms of range. A/c is used 50% time, being colder days around.\\n\\n2.Hghway drive: Recently completed Aurangabad tours with 4 people and full A/c drive. During highway drive from Pune to Aurangabad, got range of 250 kms (charged vehicle after completing 151 kms , just after Nagar ) at around 46% SOC.

For some reason the mileage seemed to fluctuate based on the driving skills and usage. Since, it was brand new, based on my driving and other criteria, it indicated a very low mileage and I overreacted and posted very negatively about the car and my sincere apologies for the same.

Tata motors has all kinds of reasons. they claim 417 km mileage they claim if one drives at 30km speed. why will i need a car if it i have to drive at 30km speed, i might as well walk! didn't expect this from the Tata's at all. just like any other company they are just there to make fools out of retail customers. please do not buy this car. it's full of false promises and deceit.\", 'Had a wonderful buying experience as rto is not applicable so it saves pretty good amount, driving experience is the next benchmark for any car.

The car is comfortable over rough patches, as well as the handling is equally good. Body roll is well sorted. I found it less bumpier than the Diesel Nexon.   \\n4) The music system will please the majority of the buyers.  \\n5) Compared to it's competitors, starting at Rs 13.99L makes this car the most value for money.  \\n6) Interiors are good and felt nicely put-together.  \\n7) Decently feature loaded.  \\n8) 205 mm ground clearance can tackle the bad roads with aplomb.  \\n9) Low running cost of an EV. \\n10) The color choices have been tastefully chosen.

Will drop even further if driven aggressively.  \\n2) Could find few small panel gaps or rough edges.  \\n3) Ergonomics could have been better. Eg the placement of the 12v socket or the driver side hand-rest and few more.  \\n4) Tyre noise and the whine of the electric motor is audible. Unless I drive the Hyundai Kona or the Mg ZS, I will reserve my opinion on the overall NVH level.  \\n5) Electronic cutoff to avoid wheel-spin should have been provided.  \\n6) Upgrading to a better tyre is recommended. The stock tyres lose grip much earlier than the chassis gives up.  \\n7) White door pads, or white leather seats in the top trim will require regular attention to keep them clean.  \\n8) Long term reliability is unknown for this car.  \\n9) Auto up/down on the drivers side power window is missing.  \\n10) The high floor-pan in rear hinders the comfort of the passenger seating in the middle.    Prelude-  \\nMr. Rik Chatterjee (Product specialist for Nexon Ev east) & Mr. Sourav Chatterjee (Territory sales manager) from Tata invited Bhpian arindam_xeta to test drive the Nexon EV and give some feedback on the car. Me being a very close friend of Bhpian arindam_xeta, I was also invited for the same.  \\nWe were with the car for more than 4 hours and drove quite a good distance within the city, as well as on open roads too.    Few facts about the car \\nThis car comes with a 30.2 kWh battery which claims to give a range of 317 km. In real condition while driving in 'D' mode the range is around 250 km and in 'S' mode it's around 190-200 km. The battery can be charged to 80% in just 60 minutes with a fast DC charger, whereas it will take more than 8 hours from a household socket.  \\nThe Nexon EV is 150-200 kg heavier than the Nexon Diesel. But this car comes with a single gear with 245 NM of instant torque and 129 ps of power. This ensures it to be quite a fun car.  \\nThe costlier MG ZS EV or the Hyundai Kona costs 20-24L on road whereas this car starts from around Rs 15L on road. The MG ZS or the Kona will enjoy a range of 100+ km more, but nothing can beat the Nexon in the value for money factor.  A small comparison between the three-    My take on the car-     \\nThis car comes in 3 variants- XM, XZ+, XZ+LUX \\nOur test drive car was the XZ+ \\nA smart watch to greet us.   \\nThis color looks stunning. My wife loved this color too. There is nothing new to write on the exterior design of the Nexon.      \\nA full Led setup would have looked more premium!    The Interior \\nAm not the right person to comment on the interiors, but I kind of felt it to be nice.  \\nThe seats are quite comfortable and supportive. The leg-space in rear and front is decent.  \\nThe A/C was a chiller. \\nThe music system should satisfy the need of the majority.  \\nThe ergonomics was more or less okay, leaving one or two sore spots. Like the position of the 12v socket or the drivers hand-rest were not quite comfortable to use. Would have preferred the hand rest in a bit more forward and a bit upward position for the driver to rest his left arm.  \\nThe top variant comes with white leather seats.       \\nIn the long run it will be tough to keep the door pads clean.    \\n350 L of boot space. The charging cable is kept inside the boot.    \\nThe flat bottom steering was nice to hold.   \\nInstrument cluster looks good with all the essential info's on display.      The Drive-  \\nThe real world range is around 250 km in 'D' mode but if driven spiritedly in 'S' mode it drastically comes down to below 190 km. Will drop even further if driven aggressively. \\nBy aggressively driving for 20 km, the range came down to 195 km from 232 km in sports mode. The battery showed 78% from 93%. So on aggressive driving for 20 km the dip was 15% with regards to charge and 38 km in range. The range makes the Nexon EV, strictly a city car.  \\nWith light foot driving in Drive mode the drop in charge and range was in acceptable range.  \\nThe driver can chose the driving mode through this knob. The brake pedal must be pressed to change the mode by using this rotary knob. Once the mode is set, releasing the brake pedal starts the vehicle to crawl without any accelerator input.    \\nA comfortable foot-well with a dead pedal.    \\n129 PS engine with 245 NM instant torque with a single speed gear ensured there is no lag and the car pulls cleanly right from the word go. Tata claims a 0-100 timing of 9.9 second, I have not tested that, but the way this car pulls, I wont be surprised if it can hit 100 km/hr even below that! The D mode is more that adequate in city but the S mode is real fun. A bit of over acceleration and the tyre screeches like crazy. Electronic cutoff to avoid wheel-spin should have been provided at-least with a turn on/off option.  \\nWhile starting from a signal it's easy to keep the traffic behind without working much on the accelerator. In one word, this car is fun to drive. It's fast. The top-speed was electronically limited to 120 km/hr, so couldn't test it beyond that on open roads.  \\nIt pulls cleanly all throughout with an even acceleration. Its not like a weak low-end or strong mid-range, the pull is even throughout the range.  \\nTyre noise and the whine of the electric motor is audible under acceleration, unless I drive the Hyundai Kona or the Mg ZS, I will reserve my opinion on the overall NVH level. Though I must say the vibration and harshness is not there, they are well sorted.  \\nThe engine bay looks neat.   \\nOn a twisty flyover within the city, I maintained the line and pushed the car a bit, the tyres screeched crazily. The tyres gave up much before the chassis gives up. Upgrading the tyres are recommended.  \\nEven these 215/60/R16 are not enough to handle the instant torque of this car. A better set of rubbers can do wonders. Torque-steer was felt under hard acceleration, but then again its a FWD car. A better set of rubbers will take care of that to some extent.    \\nThe suspension is quite well tuned. The ride is not bumpy, its quite comfortable on bad roads, plus this car can be pushed through the corners confidently. I loved throwing this car around the corners. The body-roll is well sorted. Tata has got the set-up just right. Bhpian arindam_xeta commented this car to be much more comfortable on bad roads than his Nexon diesel.  \\nThe steering weighs up in sports mode and gives adequate feedback in respect to EPS standard.  \\nThe braking feels progressive and confidence inspiring. The pedal feel is good, it's not spongy or soft. The front got Disc and the rear got drum brakes. All four discs would have been even better.  \\nThe battery pack is placed in the middle of the floor, and it's a heavy unit. Still Tata managed to give a ground clearance of 205 mm. \\nBut the high floor-pan in rear hinders the comfort of the passenger seating in the middle.   \\nThe underbelly looks neat and there are no unwanted protrusions which can get damaged on an underbelly hit. The underbelly looks well protected. \\nThe ground-clearance and the approach angle are more than adequate for a car whose majority of the life will be spent in city driving.       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plKZCuynmwE            My verdict-  \\n1) It does make sense for people who are looking to buy an automatic city car with a budget of around Rs 15-16L.  \\n2) The sub 4 meter length will ensure ease of parking, whereas the EV will ensure cheaper running cost. Tata claims the running cost to be Rs 1 per km.  \\n3) The long term reliability of this car is unknown to us, but the 8 years or 160,000 km warranty on the battery & motor with 3 Year or 1,25,000 km vehicle warranty should ensure some peace of mind. Plus the resale value of EV's in Indian is still unknown to us.  \\n4) It's a fun to drive car. Weekend morning breakfast meets can be fun in this car! It can actually keep-up with a Polo GT TSI or an Abarth Punto in 0-100 sprints. The single gear ensures there is no lag either. \\nDo make sure, if it's a spirited drive, it should be in a range of 100-150 km, not more than that. Else while returning back home, the anxiety of getting stranded by exhausting the battery will creep in!  \\n5) Overall this is the best TATA car i drove till date. My favorites were the Nexon diesel and the Hexa AWD, but this EV exceeded my expectation. (I never drove the JTP's, so this statement may not stand 100% correct.)\", 'Can you please tell us for how many km did you drive the vehicle?

With that full charge and with a conservative city range of 250 km, it is a fraction of what it will cost per km to run the same car on petrol or diesel. Twenty litres of diesel - on the other hand - will cost Rs 1500+.  \\nPlus, you don't need to replace engine oil, air filters, oil filters etc. However, I think electric cars do need some sort of coolant though (?).  \\nMaybe not for enthusiasts or for those whose daily running is quite high, but I certainly can see the advantages of an electric car. Even taking into account a sort of buffer, 250 km is enough to cater to 4-5 days of running. But one does not even need to think that much, just charge put it on charge every night and be greeted with a full tank everyday. No need to worry about fuel pump visits! \\nCONS: Will require atleast a dedicated parking space in a secure location if not an enclosed garage.

Nexon got 5* safety rating in the crash test earlier.  \\n 2) Its fun to drive. There is no lag & the car pulls cleanly. Be a bit careless, wheel spins like crazy!    \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's another pro, we don't have to use the brakes as often as we do in the regular ICE cars for slowing down, that's really cool and also almost doubles the life of brakes. Also when I drove it, felt the regen to be not so aggressive, heard somewhere that regen actually adjusts itself automatically according the state-of-charge(SOC) in the battery.

The MG ZS or the Kona will  enjoy a range of 100+ km more, but nothing can beat the Nexon in the  value for money factor.  A small comparison between the three-  Attachment 2022576    \\r\\n\\r\\nSmall correction, neither eZS nor Kona start at onroad 20L, eZS comes for around ~22L and Kona for ~25L if we add 1 lakh to the ex-showroom price.

That version will be priced  below 20L on road. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nWow, that bridges the range gap between Nexon EV and Kona/eZS, we can expect a real world range of 350KM which is on-par or better than its competitors. This makes it an even more compelling package. \\nOverall, Nexon EV fits perfectly for those who already had an ICE car and are looking for another one for in-city use with some 150~200KM occasional drives. Presently, there is no other practical EV at this price range.\", 'I got to drive the Kona EV (almost 50 Kms) and the Nexon EV (10 Kms), and I realised that in order to get a decent range from an electric vehicle we need to change our driving style. Driving with foresight and avoiding unnecessary bursts of acceleration when you see there is a speed breaker or a signal ahead and understanding how to use the regenerative braking in our favor will be very helpful to increase the range. (Regen on the nexon feels strong as there were no options to increase or decrease it) \\r\\nIn my opinion a real world driving range of 200-250 Km should be sufficient for driving inside the city without worrying about getting stranded on the road', 'Makes tremendous sense as a second city run about car. Also there are specific use cases for a few businessmen who may be required to commute 150 kms in a day  where this car will pay for the investment difference in fuel saved in a short time frame.

Thank you Samba. Enjoyed reading it. Car seems to be super fun to drive. This can be a good weekday car to anyone with a 40 km/day work week. 250/5 = 50 rupees per day is a lot cheaper than any public transport. \\nThe affordable entry price point along with practicality will encourage a lot of early adopters to make the shift towards EVs. \\nAlso, the biggest apprehension against TATA, the after sales service, shouldn't be a concern considering this car does not require many constant routine maintenance things.\", 'First of all congrats. You managed to test drive a car during this pandemic. \\nThe Cons have been carried forward from the ICE models I guess IMHO given the stats, it should be a successful product within few years.

You have previously driven the ICE version. So is it just like the ECO mode from the ICE or a mix of ECO and CITY. As you said for changing the mode you need to press the brake pedal, is there any speed limit for this?  \\nLoved your review.

But if we compare it that way, we may have to bring into picture the running costs per KM. Nexon EV at spirited driving may cost around Rs.1.2 per KM. Polo TSI at spirited driving may cost Rs.10 per KM.  \\r\\nThanks you Samba for a detailed review. This car really deserves success. It is full 9-10 lakhs cheaper than the other two EVs and has much better ground clearance than the duo.  \\r\\nThere are many even in big cities whose daily driving is 20-30 Kms a day. Such folks will be needing to charge this only once a week, even with spirited drives and stop and go crawl. Those commuting 150 Kms one way can also buy this car, provided they spend 4-5 hours at the other end. This would be enough to top up the half-gone range and be ready for a comfortable return trip.

Electric cars are the future but they are not there yet. But this comes as close as anyone has till now. I think it will take around 60-70k km to make up for the price difference purely on initial cost and fuel rate difference (I considered a nexon petrol amt for reference).

Pulled the car to the side, waited a few mins and then restarted. It worked fine for a few days and then suddenly the same thing happened multiple times at a signal. My friends in the car had to push and it was embarrassing. Anyway used the same logic of turning it off and cooling it down for a few seconds. After a few attempts, it worked fine but I escalated the issue to the specialists and they arranged me a technician within 30 minutes and he cleared some errors. Since then, I haven't noticed that issue again but it was most definitely software related.  \\r\\nAnyway, as I said before, besides these instances the car has been perfect.

Before booking, I had taken a couple of test drives. I felt that this car met most of my requirements, so I went ahead with the booking. I was told that the waiting period was 6-8 weeks. Since I was not in a hurry, I was fine with the waiting period. \\r\\nWith the lockdown enforced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, I was working from home. Hence, the need for a car was not immediate. But to have a personnel car going forward became a must. So I kept following up with KHT to understand the time frame by which I can expect the car to be allotted. I also insisted on personally checking the car before it is allotted. \\r\\nOn 25th June, I visited the stockyard of KHT motors to check the car. I also noted down the chassis number for my reference. I made the payment via cheque on the same day. On returning home, I cross-checked the chassis number to find out the manufacturing month of the car. It turned out to be manufactured in February 2020. It was a small surprise as the sales guy had told me that it was a May 2020 manufactured vehicle. On questioning, the sales guy confirmed that it was indeed made in February 2020.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nInvoice:  \\r\\nWhatsApp conversation:    Quote:   \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI couldn't resist myself and shared this experience with Tata Motors' customer care.

It came out to be 30m. Since the first 15m is free as part of the installation, I made the payment for the remaining 15m. On the day of the installation, the society executive members requested for some change in the way the cable should be laid. I think they wanted the cable to be slightly away from the rainwater harvesting ducts. Now, the installation guys wanted to re-measure the length. It came out to be 37m. They stopped the installation. They asked me to first pay for the extra 7m and only then they would do the installation. I paid for the 7m cable length (Rate of cable: Rs. 250 + GST per meter). Next day, they arrived and did the installation. I kept a sharp watch on the length of the cable used. I can confirm that the actual cable length used was NOT more than 32m. But they ended up billing me for 37m and hence there was no refund.

To check whether the car was charging or not is something that didn't cross my mind when the showroom guys were present.

Waiting is a good choice of inter city is needed because few chargers can change the whole situation.    \\r\\n\\r\\nActually i am waiting for higher battery capacity and range because even if the chargers are available in the future, i am not comfortable stopping for more than 1 hour (including the potential queues for the charger) every 150-200 km on the highway. I tend to take large breaks after every 250-300 km during longer drives. Also, most of the big cities around pune (except Mumbai) are at 220-260 km from Pune which take around 3-4 hours to travel and people normally tend to do that without a large break, so it will be convenient and hence practical to have that much range with additional 10-20% buffer charge. This way we can reach either our destinations without a forced charging break or at least upto a distance where we will willingly prefer a larger break while our cars also get charged.', 'Test Drove the Nexon EV Lux+ variant last week.

I have owned the car for more than 2 months now. I am also part of a Nexon EV owners group where in we discuss the car with passion and try to address issues and concerns as well. Here are my thoughts about the car. \\nPros :\\n1. The car is a fantastic product. I think Tata\\'s effort in putting a good product together needs to be lauded. \\n2. The car is super silent and awesome to drive.\\n3. Handling is top notch, being a SUV , it can ride on any surface. \\n4. Overall fit and finish is ok except for some gaps on the outside. \\n5. Overall a good \"City\" car if your commute is not too much and you are living in a big city and mostly travel alone.  \\nCons : \\nI think this section needs to be read carefully by all potential buyers or people with keen interest in the product.   The ARAI range may be 312km per charge but everyone needs to note that it is under standard testing conditions which are almost impractical to replicate. So \"DO NOT\" believe the shows sales guys if they tell you that range is 312km.  The claimed range of 250km is also not true. The actual usable range is no where near this figure so far. There are reasons for this. The best efficiency the car can achieve right now is 119 wh/km. With a 30.2 kw battery and 119 wh/km , max 252 km can be achieved. This is with the fact that all 30.2kw is available for use. EVs have a reserve battery range and so 100% allocation is not possible. Atleast, the existing owners of the EV have not seen 100% available. This is inspite of the fact that tata is advertising 100 wh/km efficiency on the site. The SOC (State of charge) and DTE ( Distance to Empty ) readings on the car are not reliable and very unpredictable. The trip details are also not correct and so the wh/km you see is never accurate.  Around 180 to 220 is the maximum you can extract from the car but you need to drive very sedately for this. Max speed around 50-70 . Also, at times you can only extract that range if you do not use the AC.  The AC has some issues with the current cars, even at 26 deg , it chills like 20 deg. So that adds to extra power overheads. The car has been launched with very limited charging infrastructure available right now. The limited range and limited charging infras, make it a \"city only\" car and mostly can be driven just nearby. Some people have been getting only 160km range. Tata representatives say that driving style modifications need to be done to achieve the range, however for most buyers during the pre-sales process this is never explained. The sales guys blatantly claim 250km atleast as the range and some even say more than 312 which is just not right. The remote connectivity features advertised with the car are buggy. Their app almost never works. It is very very slow even when it works seldomly. The software on the car, the battery management system is still not perfect. There have been instances when cars have been stuck at remote places and even have had issues during charging where cars just won\\'t charge or the charge went to 0 out of nowhere. The aux battery went dead on many cars out of nowhere and some cars needed to be flatbedded to the dealerships.    Most important part is about the Tata\\'s approach to the early adopters of their product. The early adopters have been trying to communicate all issues we have faced so far with Tata but there has been no proper feedback from them.  \\nTata has a good product in its hand but it needs to solve the practical issues about the car\\'s usability and software before this can become a good buy for customers.', \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by WhiteSierra   Please don't take any offense, my bad.

Even if it comes, it is not possible to do it in the current nexon's chassis. With the current range of around 200 km, the battery pack needs to be almost 2.5 times more for 500km.

They work hard and enter a segment with not a perfect product. Through WOM, trust factor goes for a toss, and they will not have anything substantial in the segment they ventured in first. Citing the opportunities in that segment, other manufacturers would enter the segment with a decent product and capture the market share. The best example is TATA Indigo - Market captured by Dzire. \\r\\nExisting owners, my intention is not to hurt any here. Wish TATA enters a segment bang on, so there is no turning back ', \"Sad to read about your experience. 200 km should be the minimum range for EVs in India- many people commute over 100 km to and from the office.  \\nThe mention of battery issues is disconcerting. Hope these things get resolved through warranty replacements.  \\nI fail to understand why ARAI continues to support fake figures for mileage and range. Many buyers might have been misled into buying this looking at the range. Now they might repent. The same thing happened with the Tigor as well.

He said the car EMI is paying by itself with the saving on fuel.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThat is true. However, point to be noted is he is having to charge on a daily basis and needs to maintain the charging infra at multiple places for that kind of usage. So point to be noted is shared public infrastructure is not there. You cannot use the car unless you have planned trips. This is not the car you can just use whenever you feel just because it is standing in your parking. It not only needs to be charged but you need careful analysis of where you are going and how far you are going when you use it. Also, the slow charging cannot be done just off \"any\" 15amp plug. It needs proper earthing and then only it charges correctly. Of course, this charging requirement is not tata specific. It is an ev requirement. But then again, it hampers the usability of the car.  \\r\\nMy advice is you should buy a car if this is your second car which you can use only for city commutes. For highways, please do not even try it as for now. Within the city it is a good car and will save you a lot on fuel compared to ICE cars .  \\r\\nOur requests to Tata : \\r\\n1. Please fix the software bugs, the unpredictable DTE and the range issues which multiple owners are having.\\r\\n2. Please fix your app. You advertise of connected features but none of them work in reality. There is no use of waiting for 1-2 minutes to fire a command from the app without even knowing whether it worked or not. We could reach the car in that time and get stuff done without the app.\\r\\n3. Please get your Fast charger network which has been promised to customers rolling asap. It is seriously hampering usability of the car.\\r\\n4. Please give the option to switch off the regenerative braking. It kills the range on short highway trip considerably.\\r\\n5. Please educate your dealers about your product. It seems customers know more than dealers at this moment. We have had bad service experiences so far because of lack of knowledge at the dealerships.\\r\\n6. Please increase the ev service dealerships considerably. Because Tata is selling this product in every nook and corner of the country but the number of dealerships that can service EVs is just a handful.  \\r\\nAgain I must say, the product is futuristic and good. But overall bundled with dealership experiences and the other issues, as a owner I feel, it is a half baked cake which has been served because market was hot.

This way you can also leave the car when you are not using for longer periods. \\r\\nAs Darthveda said, you need to full charge to 100% but I think this can be done monthly once or once every 3 months to balance the cells in a pack otherwise your BMS does not know the 100% mark ( also to 0% ) and reports wrong range numbers. \\r\\nLess fast charging and other usual suspects.', '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by pseudo_coder   I really wonder how ARAI was able to extract 312 km from the car.

Few snippets from the conversation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t Quote:   \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA month back we did the meet-up,  just after the lockdown ended. By then, in Bangalore, we had already 20  buyers we had come into contact with, and we all said that we have to  meet to know each other. We have a larger forum where we have more than  100 Nexon EV owners nationwide in a WhatsApp group which is where we got  in touch. So we formed a group where all the buyers are from Bangalore,  and started the discussion. We thought the best place would be Nandi  Hills, in and around the range that Nexon EV can provide or travel  across Bangalore city to the place. \\nAt 6 AM, we met near Hebbal  with all our cars. Keeping the distance, we communicated, we had some  quick chats about the car and our experiences, and then we started our  journey towards Nandi Hills. We had a good time. We went around the  Nandi Hill premise that is a road track around Nandi Hills and then we  had a photo op.  \\nWe were able to have an elaborate discussion  during the breakfast meeting, where we shared information about the car,  including performance. Overall, we made this trip of 130-140 km still  maintaining enough charge for commuting through the rest of the day.  \\nThere  is Adishakti motors, on the Outer Ring Road who were very much willing  to allow us to charge our cars in their premise if needed. If someone  needed to charge to reach back to their places, they could. But none of  us used that because we had enough juice in our batteries. The Nexon EV  is able to deliver around 200 km on a full charge, and we didn\\x92t do very  spirited driving. It was a fun get-together, and we were driving at  70-80 km/h speed on the National Highway.

I can be wacky.', in that robotic tone of voice. \\r\\nOn  the sidelines, a praiseworthy task by Pratap Bose, and his team, with  the Nexon FL. Electric, or not, the Nexon now dons an ardent character  and commands an undeniable road presence. \\r\\nI  will not comment on the infrastructure or the lack of it in our country.  Nonetheless, the recent amends in subsidiary policies or incentives for  purchase will go a long way (fingers crossed) in the public  acceptability of electric vehicles - though it left the Japanese,  betting big on the hybrid technology, high and dry. \\r\\nI  will not digress. The Tata Nexon EV is well priced. In my humble  opinion, the price bracket in which the Korean and the British / Chinese  counterparts operate expose the potential buyers to many a brand, many a  product, and many a time the 'value proposition' goes for a toss! \\r\\nOn  the thread, there are many a doubt lingering among the potential  buyers, and the early adopters have had their share of hiccups. \\r\\nLet me also state one of my apprehensions here, apart from the regular range anxiety and others, rightly pointed out by fellow BHPians - the battery is a consumable good with a restrictive life when compared to the internal combustion engine. I have driven ICE powered four wheelers that are more than 70 years of age. I doubt that I will be able to state that for a battery powered vehicle - I am not an expert or aware of any scientific discovery right around the corner. \\r\\nIn such a scenario, how does it affect the resale value of the vehicle, is worth a study. I appreciate that Tata Motors offers an eight years or 160,000 km warranty on its 30.2 kWh li-ion battery. But if I were to buy a second hand vehicle, I would want to know how much juice is still there in it, more so cause the cost of replacement of the battery is still a significant portion of the total cost. \\r\\nWill I make such an investment, today? No! I will buy a new vehicle. For the owner, it implies that his or her electric vehicle is depreciating at a rate far greater than the conventional drive train of the same age. A premium on the cost of acquisition and poor resale value is recipe too tough to swallow - with the cost of ownership still under scrutiny. Please note, this comment is not directed to any specific automobile manufacturer, but EVs in general, today. \\r\\nNonetheless, I reiterate, Nexon EV is a commendable step by Tata Motors  towards the democratization of the electric vehicles.

(If the manufacturers can\\'t, the government should offer this subsidy since the push for EV is very aggressive). This could be a viable market actually. Buy back existing lithium ion batteries from old EVs and recycle them. In return provide a new battery pack which would have greater energy density and probably be offered at a lower price. Win-win for car owner, environment and battery business owners.  \\r\\nSince the electric motors don\\'t have any degradation, the only issue with EVs today is heavy depreciation on batteries and the prospect of better batteries in future at lesser prices. This is a huge psychological barrier for early adopters as the purchase doesn\\'t make financial sense. It is indeed a bad deal as it stands today.

There\\'s also the intangible \"coolness\" factor.  \\r\\nThis is why Tesla went for the very high end aspirational market first to prove the capabilities of EVs and then enticed the rest of the segments with trickle down technologies.

The per kilometer running cost is definitely lower than the ICE cars, but the average lifespan of the battery is one thing which no one talks about. With such rapid use, say a couple of thousand kilometers a month for an average user, how long will the battery survive before it\\'s rendered useless and needs a replacement? \\r\\nPoint number two, the BIG and pinching question, what would be the resale value of the car ideally after 5 years and 60 thousand kilometers (a lower count though). Since an average time the first owner keeps his car is around 5 years. \\r\\nThird point, EVs can\\'t be serviced by regular joes with a set of \\'paana-pakad\\' unlike their ICE counterpart. Emergency breakdown on highways, ease of after-warranty service at FNG is questionable, specifically due to Tata\\'s after-sales service\\'s reputation. \\r\\nThe EVs are still at a very infant stage, hence no one knows what sort of issues and problems the car is going to throw at you down the line. Also in my opinion, until the time battery swap is available at every nook and corner like fuel stations, EVs do not particularly make much sense to me. The Govt. should setup an infrastructure in every fuel pump across the country where \"swap & go\" sort of battery packs are available like LPG cylinders. Getting your vehicle charged every 250 kms is highly impractical. \\r\\nOne more point I\\'d like to add her . The Govt. should make it mandatory for the battery to be of standard dimensions across all segment of EVs, which will allow a faster penetration of the technology into mass market. If an electric bike needs 1 battery, a car should need 4 or 6 of the same size and power, as per the requirement. Just like the standardized form of USB cable. \\r\\nThe bottomline is, I for one, wouldn\\'t be comfortable with an EV unless it\\'s battery is hot-swappable just like fill it, shut it, forget it.

Join the WhatsApp community of owners , it's good .    \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. This car is for my parents in Kerala and will be primarily a city car. The running will be around 5K KM per year. Usage might increase due to the fact that we dont have to pay for electricity; thanks to grid-tied solar setup at home which has been producing more electricity than we consume for the past 4 years.  \\r\\nI have been using an E2O for the past 3 years in Bangalore. I had even booked an E2O plus for my parents few years back, but the car did not have enough power to climb the steep gradient from my parking area to the main road and had to cancel the booking. We've been searching for a powerful EV since then.  \\r\\nWe cannot compare E2O and Nexon EV. E2O is more like a toy, a half baked product that just gets its job done. In an E2O, there is no ergonomics, no suspension, no safety, no boot space. But as a replacement for a 2wheeler that is supposed to transport one or two people from point A to point B within a city, it is a fantastic vehicle. I stopped using my 2 wheelers and my Cruze since the day I purchased the E2O. Last year my E2O did 10K+ KMs while my Cruze hardly ran 2K KMs and my 2 wheeler probably 100KMs. The compact dimensions of the E2O makes it an amazing city vehicle which we can drive through narrow gaps and tight parking spots.  \\r\\nIts too early to comment where and how the Nexon EV fits among these cars. Nexon EV is a proper car and will have to be used as a proper car although with a limited range. It has the safety, comfort, space, features, ergonomics, power and everything that a modern car needs but size and range makes it neither here nor there. I will have to see how it evolves as we drive it more. \\r\\nI will PM you for the whatsapp group info. I would love to be a part of that community.

The sales advisor did mention that most insurances won\\'t even cover the battery etc. Should I ignore that.    \\r\\n\\r\\n1. The batteries definitely will get cheaper, but OEM prices may not reduce that much. I checked the price of my E2O battery with Mahindra and they still claim it will be around 16K per module. Out of 16 modules, 3 have reduced capacity to 85% because of which all the remaining modules were manually recalibrated with 85% capacity reducing my range by 15%. If I change those 3 modules, my range will be back to 100%. I enquired with some Li battery dealers and they have the exact same battery module for around 6K.  \\n2. The laws of physics does apply here. 250+KM with 30KWh (28KWh available) battery might be a far fetch. A super light vehicle like e2o barely manages 80-100Wh per KM. Even with the most efficient and slow driving it is difficult to go below 110Wh per KM with Nexon. I usually average around 115Wh/KM in my Nexon despite having years of driving experience extracting the maximum range in an E2O. At this consumption rate, I may be able to touch 240KM per charge in city conditions after the update (I am yet to update the software). The recent update was to reduce the reserve battery capacity thus making 28KWh capacity available for the user. Before update it was much less. With even more careful and slow driving, you can definitely go beyond 250KMs, but that will need extraordinary patience and with a powerful vehicle like Nexon, it is just a matter of minutes before you fall for temptation to enjoy the acceleration. \\nEdit: Not aware of any OTAs yet for Nexon. You still have to visit the Service center for updates.  \\n3. Battery is covered for accidental damages by Insurance. The 12v aux battery will come under consumables and hence may not get coverage. The sales advisor must be confused with the coverage for Aux battery with main battery. To be on safer side, do take the \"Consumable Cover\" add-on which covers everything from batteries to fluids.', 'Nexon EV sales crosses 2000 mark in 10 months !

The company has stated that in just over 10 months since its launch, the sales of the Nexon EV reached 2,200 units as of November 2020.   \\nThe 1,000th Nexon EV was rolled out in August this year. The next 1,000 units were sold in a record time of 3 months (September-November 2020). The Nexon EV has emerged as the best-selling electric car in India. At present, Tata Motors claims to be leading the EV segment with a 74% market share. \\nThe Nexon EV uses a 30.2 kWh lithium-ion battery that powers an electric motor which has an output of 127 BHP and 245 Nm. The company claims that the car can do a 0-100 km/h sprint in 9.9 seconds. The battery is said to have an ARAI-certified maximum range of over 312 km on a single charge (MIDC cycle). It has fast charging capability and can be charged to 80% of its capacity using a DC fast charger in 1 hour. Using a standard AC charger, it takes 8-9 hours to charge to 100%. \\nThe Nexon EV is priced from Rs. 13.99 lakh – Rs. 16.25 (lakh ex-showroom). It comes with an 8-year / 1.6 lakh km warranty for the battery and motor. Tata Motors has also launched monthly subscription plans for the car.  Link to Team-BHP News Article', \"This is a commendable achievement by Tata! \\nAs things stand, the Nexon EV is the most affordable proper electric car in India. Also, the Nexon happens to be the only car in India that's currently available with a choice of petrol, diesel and electric powertrain options (Tigor diesel and Verito petrol & diesel were discontinued post BS6 implementation). \\nWhat Tata have shown with the Nexon EV is that it's perfectly possible to convert an ICE car platform into a good EV. I wonder what's stopping other manufacturers from doing so? Is it a serious lack of intent or a worry among manufacturers that customers would abandon ICE vehicles quicker than they would like?\", \"It's a great achievement  \\r\\nTata also has Altroz and HBX EVs in the pipeline expected to be released in the next 1-2 years. Those 2 cars will make EVs even more affordable. Hopefully, they continue to improve these EVs every 2 years with bigger batteries as the battery prices continue to decline rapidly.\", \"According to me, this is a tremendous achievement by Tata Motors for two reasons: \\n1. Nobody expected Tata to leapfrog Mahindra (with all their Reva experience) and the rest of the global brands (that have proper EVs in their portfolio already) and come up with a proper EV at a price point Indians could actually afford. \\n2. Despite being beaten to launch by Hyundai and MG, Tata Motors have had the last laugh with the Nexon EV racing ahead in sales. This is a no-brainer as the difference in range between the Nexon EV and it's rivals from MG and Hyundai isn't as significant as their retail prices suggest. \\nGood work, Tata! Now, all they need to do is to get the Altroz EV and HBX EV to the market quickly and build a substantial lead in the nascent but fast-growing EV landscape in India.\", 'The Tata Nexon is the most affordable EV I think right now.

So, the battery lasts longer than the car or any ICE car. \\n2) Battery degradation is not linear, the first year will be like 3%, 2nd year like 2%, 3rd year like 1% after that may be 1% every year. \\n3) After 8 years of warranty the battery does not go kaput, it still has 90% or in the worst case 85%. Which for Nexon EV is atleast 170km. \\n4) Batteries in a car are not similar to that in scooters or the electronics, the biggest difference is cooling, Nexon EV has liquid cooling of batteries. \\n5) As said by Mohan in the earlier post the batteries will sell for better prices after the car is scrapped and the battery can be repurposed for home storage.', \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by Mik   Finally got ours delivered. \\r\\nNew car jitters are real.

Something about it really attracts me. The drive and handling are just about perfect. However, I am disappointed at the features missing from the regular Nexon. ESC has been removed. Cruise control is gone! TPMS has also been removed for unknown reasons. Also worrying is the lack of a ‘P’ option. Instead we have to leave it in neutral with the parking brake on. This seems a little dangerous and I am surprised no one has discussed this. In addition, I would have liked 6 airbags at least on the top variant. HID or LED headlights won’t cost much and should have been provided in the existing projectors. Tata power has also started charging for fast chargers now at around Rs 18 per kwh which is rather steep. Since they had kept them free till now, they should have gone with a low rate like Rs 8 per kwh to promote EV adoption for the next year or two.  \\nAnyone knows how to join the Telegram or Whatsapp group for the NexonEV?', 'In Nexon EV, the main battery supplies power to the 12v battery.

The 12v battery charges from your main battery when the charge level is low and you are not using the lights or wipers. If you are using the lights and wipers continuously your 12v battery drains and will not charge from the main battery. \\nI am sure that your main battery should be recharged before the 12v needs your attention. I am not sure though what happens if we leave the headlights switched ON even when charging the vehicle and denying a chance for the 12v battery to charge. \\nTo your actual question, the 12v battery has less than 3% capacity than the Nexon's main battery. So, in conclusion the range may reduce by 3% if the vehicle decides to charge the 12v battery from the main battery before you reach the next charger. \\nHope this makes sense, correct me if my understanding is wrong.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by StarrySky   In Nexon EV, the main battery supplies power to the 12v battery.

If this was an isolated incident that happened only to him, what you say is fully valid. There have been multiple posts here and I know of atleast 2 friends in Chennai itself facing the same issue. Coincidentally doctors owning multiple cars where Nexon EV stopped midway on the road and the service guys after keeping it for a week or so, say the car has no problems and advise the owner to drive the EV properly. \\r\\nIs the level of customer satisfaction or post-purchase service we\\'re signing up for ?

Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by M00M    I would still recommend him to put his \"you dont know me\" attitude aside for once and check with Tata Motors and figure it out and if its still not up to the mark then identify with the team at Tata Motors whats the issue because the Nexon EV is one of the best EV in the market and this kind of target enmity towards it seems suspect from somebody who doesnt want them to get recognised.    \\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, he has already bought the car, so what enmity do you see ? And he also checked with Tata motors and based on *their* attitude he\\'s complaining as a customer. If he\\'d not reached out to anybody and his first reaction was on twitter/youtube I\\'d certainly agree with you. \\r\\nBTW a friend of mine went to check out Safari at TaMo Chromepet, Chennai. There was nobody to attend him for half an hour when the showroom was empty, apparently all the sales guys were in a meeting. Later a salesperson wasn\\'t even willing to discuss the features of the car as he was apparently busy with something else. My friend wanted to complain to the TaMo customer service but couldn\\'t find it on TaMo website - maybe it was hidden or not placed prominently. \\r\\nMy impression is while Tata has got a relatively good product in Nexon EV, it still suffers from post-sales and customer service drawbacks and needs to improve more there.

I never insulted the gentlemen neither have I roasted him. I am questioning him based on his attitude.  He bought a car, car has performance issues, before showing about whatever he owns or doesn\\x92t own, he should try to either properly learn how to drive that particular car as all cars have a different driving style or tell TAMO to fix it. Now if his driving style is perfect for an EV then there is a problem with the car. And TAMO has to fix it or they should be dragged to consumer court and told them to fix it and be penalised. Last night I saw a nexon ev YouTube video where the people from Pune drove to Goa and back in it by charging once mid way each way and they claim to have got 256 kms while going down hill and 230 kms while going up hill. They have shared all their experiences on YouTube in the video and even answered questions.  \\r\\n2. Enmity I didn\\x92t mean from the gentleman but there is targeted short burst of attacks towards nexon ev. Now if you want to go by the book on range that way Maruti and Honda and Toyota Hyundai etc and all claim to deliver 19 kmpl and even more but never do. So then we should drag them also and complain about them also. Why only target nexon ev.   \\r\\n3. Customer service is not the forte of TAMO and M&M heck even Maruti Honda Toyota and Hyundai Kia have had customer service issues. Heck even the German trio and skoda etc are blasted regularly. It mostly depends on how your service manager is and how good a rapport you have with him. So while I understand his frustration all these things need to be taken into consideration before the purchase. I personally have gone into a Kia and told to wait like how you have mentioned for 20 mins after which no one came and I saw the car and walked out. Have had a similar experience even at Skoda. Recently I went to see the Jeep Compass facelift for a friend and the TD car was in a bad shape at 3800 kms so I told them to fix it otherwise customers wouldn\\x92t buy it. Mind you even the Kia Seltos was rattling at 4500 kms on my TD . \\r\\n4. Thank you for your good wishes on me wishing to buy a nexon ev. I don\\x92t need to change my cars right now for the next few years because all my cars are relatively new and in good condition so when I do have to change I shall go for the latest product at the time in my budget and agreeing with my criteria.  \\r\\nAnd once again I have not attacked the gentleman or you or anyone else for that matter, it is a very Indian thing when someone tells you to update your skills on a new technology people get defensive. I recently drove a vintage convertible car and I kept stalling it as I was not keeping the clutch pressed longer so rather than arguing with them I followed their advice.

Only thing that is completely different with EV is regenerative breaking. Rest all parameters that influence energy/fuel consumption are the same as a conventional car. The more aggressive one is with the throttle the worse will be efficiency. The speed to efficiency correlations are also about the same.  \\r\\nComing back to regenerative breaking, I have been driving an EV for a last few months (Not an Nexon EV). I have tried to adjust my driving style to use maximize regen and tried driving with minimum regen (lifting and coasting like a conventional car). Even with the switch between the extremes, I haven't seen any notable change in the efficiency. This kind of tests have been done by other people on other EVs with similar outcomes.  \\r\\nNexon EV doesn't even feature a variable regeneration levels. In such a scenario, I am not sure what is there to learn beyond what is already know about driving economically.  \\r\\nI like Nexon EV as a product concept, but it currently isn't delivering on few critical aspects.

However if this gentleman car is delivering only 100 kms then there is something wrong with the car maybe some software glitch or battery glitch and all that is expected of a first gen product. I have not bashed anybody. I have only criticised the attitude. He should take TAMO to consumer court if he feels he has been cheated.  \\r\\nI test drove the kona EV it had a very good different levels of regen. The regen in one of the modes was very very instant. But the ride was very very stiff and there was no space behind a 6 footer.  \\r\\nI think once Tesla comes we will have rush of EV activity as manufacturers will not want to loose out to Tesla.

I got mine delivered at the end of Feb and have done 4000 Kms as of today. \\n1. Yes the vehicle had a very low range output for the first couple weeks. But that was because I didn't know how to drive the vehicle and the vehicle's engine itself, being fresh off the shelf, takes some time to get used to being your workhorse. Think of your EV as those domestic-able creatures from Avatar; you both spend some time getting to know each-other. And frankly, if you're too bullheaded for that, it would be in your best interests to do yourself a favor and never buy a vehicle outside of the class you're used to (price/performance-wise). Inevitably though, the tech even in your class will change at some point (such is the nature of tech) and you'll then have to adjust anyways. So you can either do it willingly at your own pace or it will be imposed upon you, whether or not you like it. How you deal with it is your headache. Because with time, technology always changes. Love em or hate em, EVs are here and they're here to stay. In short, don't be this guy: https://i.ibb.co/GpYYCth/Firefox-Scr...6-18-859-Z.png \\n2. With that said, I was getting a range of 175 Kms when I drove off the showroom parking lot. Within a few weeks of me getting adjusted to the car and the car having undergone a full servicing, I was up to 200 Kms of range (Highway+City). As of today, I drive my XZ+ from NCR into Delhi and get a range of 275+ Kms with the AC on 22 degrees/fan speed 3-4. \\n3. The trick is in how you drive the vehicle. Much like ICE vehicles, the harsher you accelerate/decelerate, the lesser range you get. BUT In ICE vehicles, no one really cares because you can stop and refuel anywhere. In EVs, this is an issue because you can't stop and refuel anywhere (yet). Wouldn't be an issue in the future when we have many refueling stations as we have for ICE vehicles. \\n4. I said my range is 275+ because it's actually more than 275 if you drive it at lower speeds with the AC off. Also, EVs hate linear lines on your power graphs. Give em curves. Drive like you were the chauffeur of a celebrity's Maybach S650. Gentle acceleration, minimal braking, more lifting-the-foot-off-the-pedal for decelerating. In addition, the last 10% of the EV's battery has been designed to extract the maximum range possible so those last 10 percentages gives you a lot higher mileage than the rest of the 90. The EV is smart enough to realize that at that particular stage (when you hit 10% charge), you're in a bit of a squeeze and so it starts shutting non-essential systems down one-by-one. No points for guessing how I know this. Just pray you never have to experience it. Your AC, music systems, infotainment screen brightness- all go down one by one once you're below 10%. For some people, it's a scary experience because it feels like the EV is powering down for good. But that's far from true. Like they say, it's a feature, not a bug. Quite literally, in this example. \\n5. As someone on here correctly said, don't trust the DTE. It's adaptive so it bounces all over the place. Not really a drawback, it's just too good to be of any use to a human. That extra layer of being adaptive is what breaks things for us. Anyways, you shouldn't be staring at it too much in any case, even if it's a Tesla, because you don't know whether the last system upgrade broke it. Always keep an eye on your ODO and your real-time battery usage and do the simple, basic, secondary-school math to figure out what your actual DTE is at any given time. Seriously, that should be common sense but it surprises me how it eludes so many people. \\nAnd finally, to the new owner here, congrats and welcome to the club! Don't fret, they removed the armrest, headrest, rear charging slot (from below the AC vent and moved it behind the rear-left seat), center brakelight, arm band and now the physical dials and switches for the infotainment system as well as jacked the prices up of different variants at different times of which XZ+ was repeatedly victim, no matter the slot, making it a poor choice for anyone considering the Nexon EV today. As on the other thread, I don't recommend anyone going for XZ+ trim as of today. If you're short on funds, get an XM. If you want the biggest bang for your buck, get the XZ+ Lux. They've essentially f-ed up the XZ+ with constant price hikes because it was getting too popular and they saw their chance to make some extra moolah on it.

I usually get 200KM range if I drive carefully.    \\r\\n\\r\\nUmm... based on the marketing, my car is doing fine. Not great, not bad. By comparison, I'm concerned about yours. It's not performing within the acceptable range at all. \\r\\nHere's my usual routine everyday for the past 12 days- \\r\\nI wake up in the morning, freshen up, remove the charger from the car to find it's been fully charged, I drive it a total of 110 Kms spanning highways and city streets and by the time I reach my destination, I have the battery reporting 61% charge left. In the evening, I do the same route and reach home with battery now depleted to about 19-20%. That's 220 Km a day with 80% battery. By that calculation, I can easily squeeze out 55 Kms from the remaining 20%. 220 + 55 = 275 Kms. Pretty sure I could increase the range even further if I drive at lower speeds with AC off. \\r\\nMy routine may have changed in the past 12 days but even before that when I was making shorter stretches, my calculation was still pretty much the same. Even back then, based on the performance, I could've predicted the same range for my vehicle i.e. 275+ Kms on a full charge. \\r\\nIt's noteworthy though that when I say I have the AC on, I turn it off periodically when the car is cooled and switch it back on when the interior starts to heat up again. So maybe my actual usage of the AC is actually 50% of the time only. Nevertheless, I've found it has a very negligible impact on the car's range since for the first few days of April, I was managing the entire run without AC and the range was more or less the same. \\r\\nIf I may ask a question, how often do you resort to coasting and gentle acceleration? I do it all the time, especially when on highways. You'll never see my energy consumption graph either having linear jerks in power usage or inching off the baseline too high, even on speeds above 60. You want to take advantage of the fact that an efficient EV like Nexon doesn't slow  as much as an ICE vehicle and therefore negates the need to speed back up.

One thing which people ignored is the high cost of insurance for EV vehicles.  \\r\\nHope such a calculation helps future users as a good reference.    \\r\\n\\r\\nI came to a similar conclusion myself. I easily hit 10,000KM per year when I combine both city and highway travels. \\r\\nBut then when I think about buying one I face few problems which I hope everyone will agree with. \\r\\n1. I live in a society where there are 20 story building and the parking lot is either underground or at ground level. As of now, there is no parking slot where EVs can be charged but society is thinking of parking lots for EVs where the owner will be charged for slot time and current consumption. So that is an additional cost on top of initial cost. \\r\\n2. If I have to travel to my home town, there is a possibility to charge EVs on the way, but based on Nexon's mileage I might need to charge thrice. The travel time as of now easily hits 8 hours and adding these charging time means, even if I start at 5 am in the morning I can't reach my destination before the sun goes down and I don't prefer to drive either in the night or during dusk. So practically the drive might become stressful also currently we don't have a standard charging rate, so we can't be sure that the cost of charging will be even across cities or predictable for now. \\r\\n3. I fall in a bracket where I can't afford to spend anything more than ₹20K on EMIs. I remember buying the current Ritz for a cost of around ₹5.2L 12 years back. Now no decent car with the same engine capability is available at the same cost. My salary has improved year on year based on industry standards, but then the cost of living is growing way too high that forget EVs even an ICE car with the same capabilities are becoming unaffordable luxury items and I don't own a home and still living off rented apartments, so for me, savings is more important because we don't have a practical social security measure which can help live an old aged person with the pension options currently available. So when I think about the future, sometimes I feel a car is an unnecessary depreciating investment. \\r\\nThanks to the current COVID situation my friend now thinks his brand spanking new car is sitting idle while his wallet is leaking money in the range of ₹20K per month (His salary falls around ₹15L per annum bracket). Further because of his back issues, he could buy only a car with a high sitting position and is automatic. Now it's value is going down month by month while it's sitting idle in the parking lot. \\r\\nHence the only way EVs might become a value is when the price comes down considerably and also the mileage is equivalent to ICE. So in my mind for a single car owner, if the total initial cost of 5 seater EV is below ₹10L including the interest on EMIs and it can travel for 450KMs in a single charge, then it's worth considering but I don't think that is imaginable at the least for foreseeable future.\", '    https://youtu.be/qMAgV2M5QVQ          \\nAttempted a 0 to 60km/hr drag run in my Tata Nexon EV measured by my Vbox device called the Racebox pro.

AA showed the song running in the background, as did my phone, but increasing or decreasing the volume would only change the FM sound, as if the volume slider didn't recognize my music playing over AA whatsoever. Annoyed, I gave up after a few attempts and tried Youtube to play music. Voila! Everything works normally! No FM playing in the background and no unnecessary audio cutting off.

So please bear with that. \\nSo I got my car for about 12.5 on road\\nAnd when I check cars24, my model, COULD fetch 8.5 \\nSo that’s 4 lacs spent for 5 years \\nMy daily drive is a mix of city and Highway and I generally get a mileage of 16kmpl and an annual running of 18k kms.\\nSo considering that, the fuel expenses on an average for a year come to around 90k considering the fuel increased from 62 back then to 97 today!  \\nMy 5 years of ownership has been pretty smooth. The maintenance cost I think would be around. Let’s say 10k a year considering battery change and regular service etc. Not including tyres, brake pads etc which would be common in both cars! \\nSo the cost of ownership translates to about 1.8 lacs a year! \\nNow, moving on to Nexon here, I plan on getting the mid variant which could cost me around 14 lacs tops considering the 2.5L subsidy in Maharashtra. And say 20k of electricity charges a year.\\nNow the ultimate question being the resale of this car! EVs are yet unknown entities here and considering the battery technology improvement, 5 years later I am not sure if Nexon’s battery and technology would still be meaningful and in demand with the time then!\\nPlus a slew of eVs might appear in the next 2-3 years!\\nSo if I don’t get a good resale value, this car might turn out to be more expensive than a car which gulps down diesel @100₹/L!\\nA resale value of less than 5lacs makes brezza a good deal! \\nSo should I hold onto brezza and wait for better eVs in the market in the next 2-3 years or get the Nexon now?

Buying an EV is like taking a step forward in the right direction. You choice of EVs both Nexon and Altroz appear capable for our Indian urban runs.\\nTo control the cost of ownership may I suggest you enquire with the dealer possibility to take out extended warranty as the standard warranty of 3 years appears to be rather limiting. It will also be worthwhile to enquire the cost of a service plan which seems to be one way to keep a tab on costs.\\nThe only other variable would be electricity costs which are always on the rise (albeit not as much as Diesel or Petrol price rise). Do you have an option to produce your own electricity using Solar ? I know it is a hefty investment but pays back in long term.\\nRegarding resale value, I am always told that EVs hold their resale value much better than fossil fuel cars. Here in UK, we have examples of 2013 Renault ZOE and Nissan Leafs selling for handsome price by the market standards. I must admit that brands like Tesla are fetching better resale value and I think it is because of customer confidence in the brand. Tata's were not known to inspire customer confidence but I understand that this sentiment is now on decline. \\nPlease keep in mind the fact that EV demand across the world is on the rise and Lithium is in short supply. We are experiencing a wait time of upto 6 months on new EVs in UK which is not helped by Semiconductor shortage. This is one of the reason why traditional manufacturer do not commit to EV as they cannot produce enough in the coming years. This unfortunate situation plays into hands of those lucky who managed to buy an EV, it indirectly guarantees a high resale price for EVs for coming years due to adverse demand supply situation. \\nRegarding battery technology, I expect it to improve over time but that should not affect the value of the car as long as it delivers close to advertised range. \\nMay I suggest you to do your research on your usage requirements and compare it against the advertised range for the EVs you shortlisted. Unfortunately not many EVs manufacturers in India are publishing WLTP ranges, so asking around might be best bet. \\nIf at all possible, it might be a good idea to hire an EV for a few days and try it.\\nThere is a lifestyle change with EVs and how much it affects you depends on your usage requirements. \\nWish you all the best.\", '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by Jash2709   Plus a slew of eVs might appear in the next 2-3 years!\\nSo if I don’t get a good resale value, this car might turn out to be more expensive than a car which gulps down diesel @100₹/L!\\nA resale value of less than 5lacs makes brezza a good deal! \\nSo should I hold onto brezza and wait for better eVs in the market in the next 2-3 years or get the Nexon now?

The EV tech will only get better with time and hopefully more affordable as well.\", 'Last weekend I finally got a chance to drive the Nexon EV for a good amount of time. I had exchanged it with my friend who bought the car approx 10 months ago. The variant that he has is the top of the line XZ+ I don’t clearly remember the suffix to it and this is the one with white colored leather upholstery. \\nI’ve been driving the Vento TSI now for the past 4 years. The torque and the power of TSI has left me spoilt. Coming from that to the EV I was awestruck. The torque surge that the Nexon throws even in D mode is thrilling! Thank god the tyres were changed to Michelin PST4. \\nSunday morning took the car out for a breakfast drive with a friend to Kyani & Co. for some Bun Maska and chai. The battery after the entire round trip was down to 67 percent. I started the drive with a 93 percent battery. I do not have a charging point at my house so I decided to just google and find the charging stations that were available close to my house and actually try and figure out how to use them. After my return I found one close to my house where I anyways had to go to buy some groceries. The charging station asked me to download some app called Electreefi, the app is no short of bugs. It could not locate my location even if the location services on my phone was switched on. The app wasn’t ready to load any money into the wallet. I had to resort to calling the customer support to help me with the step by step process to get it done. After finally figuring out how to charge the vehicle I had preset a 30 min timer so that it would be on course with me getting my shopping done. I think this has to be the best part of owning an EV. You can charge and your errands also are getting done! I think EV for the city makes perfect sense? I then had almost 90 percent charge in the car and decided to unplug it as it was almost lunchtime and I hadn’t eaten anything after that bun-muska. After pressing on cancel on the screen of the charging station. The screen showed please remove the gun. Tadaaa guess what? The gun was locked. It did not wish to be removed. I had to resort to calling the customer support guy again. He told me to do lock-unlock the car a few time and give it a try. To my agony even that did not help. After a few attempts he asked me to start the car and engage it in D mode. Surprisingly this worked. Till now don’t ask me how, but it did. Thankfully we were able to come back home. The total charge costed me somewhere close to 210 bucks inclusive of GST.  \\nComing to the driving dynamics of the car, the car is super comfortable over bumps and undulations. I think for being a crossover it does a good job. The battery hissing noise is a bit evident inside the cabin but I increased the volume of the music so that I cannot hear that. The speakers that this car comes with is crisp, the balancer works phenomenally. The drawback would be the positioning of the horn, I found it tough to operate as only my thumb could reach it and also sometimes it used to end up pressing the control on the steering. The lack on cup holders on the front door pockets are sorely felt. I had bought a can of coke on my way back but did not find a proper place to keep it. The gear knob takes some time getting used to. I’m still confused as to should I turn it left or right and I end up wrongly shifting it. I found the seats to be comfortable enough for my liking. I think after the current subsidy that the Maharashtra government has announced on EV I think this is worth taking the plunge into the world of EV for someone who might use it on a daily basis. \\nAttaching some photos from my weekend with the EV.

Currently EV manufacturers recommend somewhere around 5:1 AC: DC charging. Meaning, You will need to use AC charging 5 times if yo use DC charging once. This is to ensure Longevity of Battery life. By using DC charging all the time, battery degrades faster and you will lose range within a few years. \\nYou do not have to run a wire from your 10th floor. \\nThe best options for you would be to  \\n1) Run the Wire from you Electricity Meter(Assuming its at the ground floor) and fix a 15A Socket on a wall somewhere near to your usual parking area.

It is quite possible in urban areas like Bombay. There are dozens of chargers all around Bombay, Navi Mumbai etc. You can charge once a week at your convenience if you are ok with waiting around 1 to 2 hours at the charger. Many of these are near restaurants, malls and other businesses areas so you can go eat something or take a walk. Manufacturers do recommend a slow charge after every 4 or 5 fast ones. So once or twice a month, locate a place like a mall that provides slow charging. Either hang out there or take some transport to work or home and then pick up the car in the evening. Many malls provide free charging in Delhi NCR and it might be the same in Bombay. Otherwise find a friend or relative you can visit once a month where you can charge. So despite people's vehement opposition, it is quite possible.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by docelectric2020    If  you are to park elsewhere, then run an extension socket from this 15A socket to your car.

The car performed really well. So I did two runs on different days one with A/c turned on and the other without the AC. Being a hilly area with steep inclines I managed 1% for every 1 km. AC or Non AC doesn't make much of a difference. Tried ECON mode several times but it starts fogging up the windscreen and side windows, so didn't find it of much use. \\nWhat I love the most over my Tesla Model 3 is that Nexon is much more silent when it comes to road and wind noise. Also I couldn't hear any rattles in the car unlike my old safari and Model 3. The ride is smooth whereas Model 3 is pretty harsh. The sound system in Model 3 is definitely better but the Nexon didn't disappoint that much. \\nWhat I miss the most is the cruise control or the regular autopilot from Model 3, even a regular cruise control will be a great addition. The annoying thing in Nexon is that initial second lag that it has, I think it is in place for bumper to bumper traffic condition, but that is not something you see in Model 3. \\nFew things they need to add is different Regen levels, as when I was coming downhill the car slowed down way too much and pretty much came to a halt if the decline is not too steep. \\nCruise Control is a must. \\nThe Hill assist is annoying, I would have preferred a hill hold feature. There were couple of times where cars in front of me came to a standstill and I had to stop on the incline. Now cars behind don't leave you much room, so you have to do the old way of pulling the handbrake and then accelerating. Because the hill assist lets your car roll back little and the it accelerates ahead. But by that time you have already banged into the bumper of car behind. So I don't trust it much.   \\nThis car won't be that successful during the winter time in areas where it snows a lot and temperature drops too much. My Model 3 loses 40% of its range during winter time, the regen is disabled while the battery is cold and even though it got the heat pump, still it doesn't make much of a difference. So have to see how will Nexon perform.  \\nOverall its a really good package and will only improve from here. Tata customer service has been good so far, atleast you get a human to talk to unlike Tesla where emails go unanswered and if you come across a human then god must be looking after you that day. \\nIn terms of comfort I can say the Tesla seats are bit better and little wide, found Nexon seats a bit narrow, but I love the rear seat comfort of Nexon. The floor height of Model 3 is way too high, like your knees are pretty much in your chest. \\n Happy so far with the purchase and feel proud of what Tata has achieved and hope someday the Harrier comes as an EV and I'll be the first in line to order it.   \", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by officer416   Did a range test by visiting a popular tourist destination in my state.

But, it is being used as their primary car now. Seven-eight months back, only 45 per cent of customers wanted EV as a first car, but today 60 per cent of them want it as a primary car. Once the primary car usage of EVs starts increasing, it is an indication of mainstream buyer. And this is the big change that we have seen. Also, although Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle (FAME) incentive is not applicable to the personal segment, the State government incentives which are coming says that if the car is compliant to the FAME scheme it is applicable, and we have taken FAME certificate for both (Tigor EV and Nexon EV). So, if I want to sell in the fleet Nexon EV, we'll get the FAME incentive because it is below ₹15 lakh and we meet the localisation requirement as per the FAME phased manufacturing plan. We are the only one who qualifies for the State incentives. So with this, there is an explosion of demand now, which is not getting reflected in the numbers because numbers are limited to the supplies. But, just to give you an idea Nexon EV bookings are equal to the bookings of Nexon Diesel, which is also a successful variant. Seven cities including Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru are nearly 60 per cent of our demand.

Whether it's a fan or an EV motor, if you manually rotate it, it becomes a dynamo, ie it generates electricity. But that doesn't come free, you need to apply force to turn it, ie there's resistance. That's how regenerative braking works. The motor keeps spinning because of inertia, it generates electricity to charge the battery, that causes resistance that feels like strong engine braking.  \\nTo the question of parking an EV: I don't know the answer.

I want it primarily because I like cars which have good acceleration. Some of my previous cars are the Vento TSI, Cruze, Getz CRDi and the Palio GTX.

My second question is whether I need to drive at a max of 80 KMph and avoid sudden acceleration and deceleration to do it.    \\r\\n\\r\\nI think you are the perfect candidate for a Nexon EV. I would suggest even Tigor EV, which saves you a bit of money and should inherently bit more efficient than Nexon, due to it's sedan design (less frontal area =  reduced air drag). \\nBefore I had my Tesla model 3 (SR+), I had been using Ioniq electric (28kWh) and BMW i3 (33kWh/94Ah) for some months (at different points in time) as my only car. The Nexon EV is comparable in range to these 2 models, with Ioniq being a bit efficient but with lower capacity battery and i3 with a bit larger capacity & less efficient. Nexon falls right in the middle in terms of capacity and qua efficiency is more on i3's side. So I guess I can give you some practical insights. \\nHere is a comparison of Ioniq and i3, regarding range and charging :   \\nMy home work commute is 76km (42-45min) oneway and I had options to charge at home (Type 2/11kW) and office (16A / 3kW). But, most of the days I don't even charge at office as I can easily get ~180kms in both cars (10-90% SoC). Note that I just set climate control comfortably and accelerate quickly. I don't baby the cars because it is an EV. Somedays when I want to go somewhere (shorter/locally) in the evening just after coming back home, then I would plug it in office so that I can come home and immediately depart without charging time needed. In your case, probably you have to consider these scenarios as well. Only during winter, I will have to plug in the cars at office to top up so that I will not go below 10% SoC on my way back home. But with our weather in India, we don't have to worry about efficiency dropping due to heater usage (unless you are living in colder regions). \\n( OFFTOPIC: Actually Ioniq and i3 experience made me confident to choose a model 3 SR+, inspite of me having the option to choose Long range. I chose SR+ as it is more than enough for my use case and it is ~250kgs lighter than LR. Lighter the car, nimble it is to flick in corners. Also in 2019, when i got mine, model 3 SR+ was using the same rear motors as Model 3 LR AWD Performance. And normal LR AWD was using a different rear motor. Now-a-days SR+ and LR AWD use the same motor, while LR AWD performance uses a different motor. ) \\nOther downside you have to consider is the power cuts we have in India, esp. if you workplace does not have a power backup. Here in NL, I have never faced any power outage in the last decade since I came here. So I didn't have to worry about this part. But BLR-Chennai corridor is getting fast charging infrastructure faster than some skeptics have ever imagined. So for long run, I don't think you have to bother about power cuts when you are at work. Check for www.plugshare.com for EV chargers near your location. I see charging companies and users updating these frequently. \\nIMO, you should be good with either new TigorEV or NexonEV.

I have heard that petrol cars can not refuel at home while you  sleep? How often do you have to refill elsewhere? Is this several times a  year? Will there be a solution for refueling at home? Which parts will I need service on and how often? The car  salesman mentioned a box with gears in it. What is this and will I  receive a warning with an indicator when I need to change gear? Can I accelerate and brake with one pedal as I do today with my electric car? Do I get fuel back when I slow down or drive downhill? I assume so, but need to ask to be sure. The car I test drove seemed to have a delay from the time I  pressed the accelerator pedal until it began to accelerate. Is that  normal in petrol cars? We currently pay about 0.5 Rupees per Km to drive our electric car. I  have heard that petrol can cost more than 10 times as much so I reckon we  will lose some money in the beginning. We drive about 20,000 Km a  year. Let's hope more people will start using petrol so prices go down. Is it true that petrol is flammable? Should I empty the tank and  store the petrol somewhere else while the car is in the garage? Is there an automatic system to prevent gasoline from catching fire or exploding in an accident. What does this cost? I understand that the main ingredient in petrol is oil. Is it  true that the extraction and refining of oil causes environmental  problems as well as conflicts and major wars that over the last 100  years have cost millions of lives? Is there a solution to these  problems? I have heard that cars with internal combustion based engines are  being banned to enter more and more cities around the world, as it is  claimed that they tend to harm the environment and health of their  citizens?? Is that true??   I may have more questions later, but these are the most important  ones to me at the moment.  Thank you in advance for your reply.\", \"Mod Note: No more off-topic posts please.

He was assured the both the cars (Dinar\\'s and Mine) would be definitely delivered from the next lot.\\n- On 17th February 2022, Dinar\\'s car reached the stockyard but mine didn\\'t. On asking the dealer they said they had only received 1 XZ+ Dark Edition and one Lux variant. When I asked why my car wasn\\'t dispatched despite being promised, the dealer said that they can\\'t do anything if Tata does not give them cars.\\n- I then contacted Mr. Ramzaan who said that they had dispatched 2 XZ+ cars, one of which was delivered to Yuri. So where did the 2nd car go? And this was from the previous lot. I would have still kept quiet if they had sent 2 cars in the 17th February lot.\\n- I also questioned the dealer on this issue. They were quick to cover up by saying that the 2nd car was a Lux variant despite Mr. Ramzaan confirming that 2 XZ+ Dark Editions were dispatched. Later they had some internal discussions and took a common stand that there was some misunderstanding and the 2nd car was a Lux variant.\\n- While this was going on we also noticed that other people were taking deliveries of Dark Editions particularly from the newly opened (December 2021) Panjim branch of SP Motors. We saw cars being delivered as well as photos on Social Media. We also came to know that some customers got their cars within 20 days of booking. The dealer responded that those were old bookings. I asked them, if they were old bookings how come you did not tell us that these people are in line before us. They said that they do not have data of bookings from the Panjim showroom. Well if that was the case then the bookings had to be made after mine as I booked in November and the Panjim showroom opened in December. To this they replied that the staff of the Panjim showroom was operating from the Nuvem showroom prior to December. Now this is really hard to believe as it is very unlikely that the dealer is unaware of bookings made at their branches as the all the orders are placed collectively.\\n- I spoke to the GM Sales of SP Motors Mr. Amey who denied any out of turn deliveries. He also said that there were customers before me whom he was bypassing in order to help me. These were customers who had not taken delivery due to financial issues or waiting for the subsidy to be announced.\\n- The dealer offered me the option of taking either a Dark Edition Lux or a White or Teal XZ+ variant. I was not interested but I said I would consider if a substantial discount was offered. Now how did they have these cars in stock when cars are ordered only against bookings and Tata only dispatches cars against orders. The dealer claims that Tata pushes them to take XM and Lux variants. Why would Tata do that? There are dealers all over India who would be having bookings for these variants. If there were no bookings Tata would have not produced them and concentrated on the variants that were in demand.\\n- I also gave them the option of giving me a demo car to use till the delivery of my car as this whole mess was created by them and they have not honoured their verbal commitment on delivery dates. They declined stating that they have Test Drives scheduled and cannot cancel them. However when I was asking for my 2nd Test Drive, I was told that it had to be scheduled a few days later as the car was with one of the Municipal Councils in South Goa for a few days as they wanted to Test the car prior purchasing. They are now denying this.\\n- I am a seafarer by profession. I am scheduled to be on standby for joining my ship from 20th February onwards. I had booked the car on the assurance that I would get delivery in January and have at least a month to drive the car. I explained to them that had they not given a false commitment, I could have explored some other options (Non EV) and had fun driving.\\n- I then demanded to speak to some higher ups in Tata. After a lot of pushing they finally agreed and put me on conference call with Mr. Ramzaan and Mr. Ankur Singh. I explained the situation to him. He initially took the side of the dealer stating that there are 27 booking before me. When I told him, that I have booked a Dark Edition and I was informed that I was 3rd in line he finally agreed to make sure my car was \"delivered\" in February. I asked for the same in writing to which he said that he would instruct the dealer to do so via e-mail.\\n- I didn\\'t receive the same. The next day after several calls to the dealer, I received the mail in the evening. However the mail stated that the car would be \"billed\" on or before 28th February 2022. The time between billing and delivery is usually 8-10 days. I quickly pointed out the same to the dealer who refused to change it stating that these were the instructions from Tata. I tried to contact Mr. Ramzaan several times but he refused to answer my calls. He also read my WhatApp messages but did not reply. Finally yesterday (18th February 2022), I went to the dealership and demanded to be put in touch with Mr. Ankur Singh. After a long discussion he agreed to send the mail by evening. I asked him what happens if the dealer says he can\\'t deliver as Tata has not dispatched the car. To that he said, \"If you are looking for compensation, I will put delivery by 15th March 2022 failing which compensation will be provided\". I told him I was interested in getting the car not the compensation.\\n- Anyway till midnight there was no mail. I sent him a reminder. This morning I received a reply that he was travelling so could not send the mail. He sent a mail stating that \"We are hopeful to deliver vehicle on or before 28th February 2022\". I sent him a reply that as per our conversation the commitment was supposed to be to \"definitely\" deliver the vehicle not \"hopefully\". I am still waiting for his reply.\\n- During our last conversation he had also assured me that my vehicle is going into production on 18th February 2022. However at the time of writing this post, the vehicle has not yet been billed. \\nThis has been my side of the story.

In city, the regen is actually quite useful as you can truly achieve single-pedal driving. On the highway (and even in the city), you can opt for the S mode which significantly reduces the regen, however makes the accelerator more responsive. BTW, S Mode on the highway is great for improved range, as you can see in this video:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOGN-hG1DPw         \\r\\nSo don't let that be a reason for not adopting the NEV.

No long highway runs\\n• Stiffer suspension than the regular Tigor means you feel more of the road. Bad roads are felt\\n• Power tapers off after 100 km/h; top speed of just 120 km/h\\n• Smaller 316L boot (regular Tigor = 419L) due to the intrusive spare tyre\\n• Some misses such as \"P\" mode on the shifter, adjustable regen braking & alloy wheels\\n• A rare Tata car that cannot seat 5 (best for 4 adults)\\n• Tata\\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble\\n• It\\'s a brand-new technology, so there will be issues & niggles  This review has been jointly compiled with Aditya & GTO. Thanks to them for the expert observations!   Introduction \\nTata has been proudly selling India\\'s most affordable \"proper\" electric car, the Nexon EV for a while now. And it has been rewarded too = in July & August, the company has moved ~600 units of the Nexon EV. More important than that though is how these sales & heavy customer feedback help the company learn more about the game-changing EV technology. To widen its reach, Tata now introduces the even more affordable Tigor EV. Electric vehicles are going mainstream - there\\'s no doubt and this is definitely a sigh of relief for people who are fed up with pollution levels & the rising prices of fossil fuels.  \\nDo note this isn’t the first-ever Tigor EV. Back in 2017, Tata Motors won a tender to supply 10,000 Tigor EVs to the government-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), and the car was later made available to select rental services like Zoomcar. However, that was more of a learning experiment. The car you see here is quite different from the previous one and is made specifically keeping the private car owner in mind.  \\nThe 2021 Tigor EV gets a Permanent Magnet Synchronous motor (instead of an AC induction motor) that puts out 74 BHP & 170 Nm (34 BHP & 65 Nm more), as well as a larger 26 kWh battery pack which gives the car an ARAI-certified range of 306 km (164 km more). You can expect a real-world range of ~200 km. There’s plenty more to talk about the drivetrain, so keep reading. The Tigor EV is offered in 3 trims – XE, XM, XZ+ (with a dual-tone option available in the XZ+ variant) and 2 colour options - Signature Teal Blue (our test car) and Daytona Grey.   Tata Tigor EV Price & Brochure\\nPrior to the launch, there were rumours that the Tigor EV would be a sub-10 lakh rupee car. Clearly, that’s not been the case. The Tigor EV has been launched at the following prices; XE - Rs. 11.99 lakh, XM - Rs. 12.49 lakh, XZ+ - Rs. 12.99 lakh and XZ+ Dual Tone - Rs. 13.14 lakh (ex-showroom). Compare these prices with the equivalent petrol-powered variants of the car and there’s obviously a massive difference. Variant to variant, the price premium is ~5.5 lakh (petrol automatic vs electric)! This is a lot & clearly just for early adopters, but for someone who’s looking at an entry-level electric car, the Tigor EV is one of the cheapest options on sale currently. \\nThat being said, we will tell you that the Nexon EV is priced not too far away. The Nexon EV XM variant starting @ Rs 13.99 lakhs is totally worth the price difference. It is the superior car.    \\nYou can download the 2021 Tata Tigor EV brochure here - Tata Tigor EV Brochure.pdf  Incentives \\nApart from the central government\\'s incentives, states are offering additional perks to promote the use of electric vehicles. Maharashtra recently revised its EV policy, which capped the total incentive on electric 4-wheelers at Rs. 2,75,000. This includes a basic incentive of Rs. 1,50,000, an early-bird incentive of Rs. 1,00,000 and a scrappage incentive of Rs. 25,000. Incentives totalling Rs. 1,75,000 will be offered on vehicles purchased after December 31, 2021. Also, the registration and road tax has been waived off on all EVs.  \\nFurthermore, income tax benefits are available under section 80EEB (only applicable for vehicles registered by individuals) - click here to read a detailed article on the same.    Running Costs \\nGiven the high prices of fossil fuels, the cost of running a vehicle has been a pain point for many. Let’s run down simple math for the Tigor EV. The battery capacity is 26 kWh, which means it will need 26 units of electricity for a 100% charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it’s about Rs. 8 per unit. In this case, you’ll be paying Rs. 208 for a full charge. While the ARAI certified range is 306 km, you can expect a real-life driving range of ~200 km under normal driving conditions. Translated, you’ll be paying just Rs. 1.04 per km which is an incredibly sweet figure. This number feels even more impressive when you consider that the average petrol compact sedan costs you 8 - 9 bucks / km (FE of 12 in the city), while a diesel will cost you 6 - 7 bucks (FE of 15 in the city).   Want to know more about EVs?  Read GTO\\'s excellent article (Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head) on the topic.  Exterior  Design & Styling \\nThe Tigor has always been a smart-looking sedan, and there are a few design elements to differentiate the EV variant. For starters, the signature \\'Teal Blue\\' paint shade and black roof are exclusive for the Tigor EV. Then, multiple blue accents at different locations and the \\'EV\\' badges, further remind you that it’s an EV. The best part for owners will be the green number plate, which many wear as a badge of honour!   Build Quality, Fit & Finish \\nThe build is solid and the car doesn’t feel flimsy at all. With a kerb weight of 1,235 kilos, the Tigor EV is heavy. The hefty battery pack contributes significantly to its weight.  \\nFit & finish of some of the parts could have been better though. As an example, the blue highlight below the front grille on our test car was slightly misaligned. Then, the ORVM glasses on our test car kept shaking & vibrating over bad roads. The Teal Blue paint, on the other hand, is of good quality and has a nice, glossy finish.   Wheels & Tyres \\nThe top variant of the regular Tigor is offered with 15-inch alloy wheels wrapped with 175/60 section rubber. The Tigor EV comes with 14-inch steel wheels & 175/65 section tyres. Sadly, no alloy wheels! Our test car was shod with Apollo Amazer XP series rubber, which are low resistance tyres specifically designed for efficiency. The steel wheels are offered with wheel covers that make them look like alloy wheels. No doubt, these 14-inch rims do look small for the size of the car.  \\nThe Tigor EV is heavier than the regular Tigor by ~200 kg, and since the battery pack is sitting below the boot, there is more weight at the rear. Hence, the recommended pressure for the front tyres is 33 PSI, while that for the rear tyres is 38 PSI.  Ground Clearance \\nTo bear the additional weight, Tata has made changes to the suspension as well. As a result, the Tigor EV has an unladen ground clearance of 172 mm, which is 2 mm more than the regular Tigor.   Standard & Extended Warranty \\nThe Tigor EV is offered with a standard warranty of 3 years / 125,000 km, which is 1 year more than the regular Tigor. Details of the extended warranty haven’t been revealed yet, but you must make an entry in your to-do list and take it (new technology after all). You get an 8 year / 160,000 km warranty on the battery pack and electric motor as standard.  Maintenance \\nThe Tigor EV has a service interval of  6 months / 7,500 km. EV maintenance is far simpler than ICE cars as there are no oil changes & filters to carry out.   Safety \\nThe Tigor EV has scored a commendable 4-stars in the Global NCAP crash tests. The car comes with dual airbags, ABS + EBD + corner stability control, reverse parking camera and sensors, hill descent control and hill ascent assist. Apart from this, the battery pack and motor get an IP67 rating which means they are dustproof & waterproof.  Interior    Cabin Design & Quality \\nNothing has changed on the inside, except for a small handful of cosmetic bits and feature additions. Tata introduced the dual-tone black & white dashboard with the Tigor facelift and the same is seen on the EV too. The only changes here are the blue accents on the dashboard and the new seat fabric design.   Unique & Noteworthy Features \\nThe Tigor EV comes with almost all the features you’d expect in a compact sedan. These include a 7-inch touchscreen head-unit with Android Auto & Apple CarPlay and a digital instrument cluster. You also get iRA (Intelligent Real-time Assist) connected technology, which offers features like intrusion alert, remote immobilization, geofencing, time fencing, remote door lock/unlock, remote cooling, remote vehicle diagnostics, trip analytics etc.    Boot Space \\nThis is where things have changed drastically compared to the regular Tigor. Since the battery pack is placed under the boot, the spare wheel is actually kept inside the boot on the right-hand side! This noticeably chews away boot space. As a result, the Tigor EV has a 316-litre boot compared to the regular Tigor’s 419-litre unit.', 'Driving the Tata Tigor EV\\r\\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor puts out 74 BHP & 170 Nm of torque. That\\'s far lower than the Nexon EV\\'s 127 BHP & 245 Nm:  \\r\\nBefore we get to the driving part, let\\x92s get some basics right. There are 3 main components in an EV \\x96 the battery, the motor and the controller/charger. The battery is what stores the energy and the motor is what uses that energy to move the car. The controller/charger converts the energy from the battery into a usable form to power the motor. In more technical terms, the power grid from your house or a charging station is usually an AC current. The lithium-ion battery can store electric energy in DC form. So while charging, there\\x92s usually an AC/DC converter that will convert the power grid\\'s AC into DC and store it in your car\\x92s battery. The DC fast chargers that you see usually have the AC/DC converter inbuilt, which is how they can charge your car\\x92s battery faster. The controller typically sits on top of the motor. In the case of the Tigor EV, the controller and motor are placed under the bonnet.  \\r\\nNow, let\\x92s get to the driving part. Most of us are still getting used to the eerie silence of EVs after pressing the start/stop button. But it takes just a couple of drives to feel comfortable with it. \"Start\" the car and its digital speedometer goes all the way up to 160 km/h, then dropping back to 0. There are 4 transmission modes to choose from \\x96 D, R, N and S. \\x91D\\x92 mode is more designed for city driving conditions, while \\x91S\\x92 mode is when you want that extra power (at the cost of FE, which in this case is the battery charge level). We sure wish there was a \"P\" (park) mode like the Hyundai Kona & MG ZS EV which would lock the wheels in place. Right now, your only option is \"N\" with the handbrake. Tata should fix this in its future EVs.  \\r\\nAs a safety feature, the car will always start in \"N\" mode. Engage D, take your foot off the brake pedal and the Tigor EV gets off the line in a perfectly smooth manner, crawling at 6 km/h. It\\x92s very linear and without any jerks. With 170 Nm of torque available from 0 rpm, Tata claims that the Tigor EV has a maximum restart gradeability of 29-degrees. Meaning, the car can crawl forward from a standstill on an incline of up to 29 degrees with ease. \\r\\nDriving around in \"D\" mode within the city is a super convenient affair. No clutch, no gears, no turbo lag & no noise means even a newbie driver will seem like a smooth driver. The motor has sufficient torque, but it is used conservatively in \"D\" mode for a smoother driving experience & to maximise driving range. Think of \"D\" being more like \"ECO\" mode. Performance in D mode is decent, but that\\'s it. You won\\x92t have any issues keeping up with city traffic & power is sufficient for day-to-day commuting. When you want to suddenly accelerate from say 40 - 50 km/h though, you will feel the power deficit & it feels like a 1.2L NA petrol! If you want quicker acceleration, simply switch to \"S\" mode and you\\x92ll notice a BIG difference in the way the power is put down. Throttle response is much sharper and you get a stronger surge of power. Added bonus = in \"S\", you\\'ll see the power gauge on the left showing a redline at the limit (via 3 red bars), just like a conventional rev counter.  \\r\\nOut on the open road, D mode is adequate for regular drivers. You can cruise comfortably on the expressway. However, if you need to execute an overtaking manoeuvre quickly, S mode comes in handy. You\\'ll also find yourself engaging \"S\" mode whenever you are in the mood for some fun. The Tigor EV feels peppy in Sport mode, even on the open road. Power is delivered strongly till 100 km/h, after which it starts to taper off. The Tigor EV\\'s top speed is limited to an indicated 122 km/h (GPS showed 116 km/h) and progress from 110 - 120 km/h is quite slow. Must add that electric cars aren\\'t good at high-speed cruising, from the range point-of-view. Drive continuously at 110 - 120 km/h in \"S\" mode and you\\'ll see the battery level drop alarmingly fast. That\\'s one of the reasons you\\'ll see most EVs driving at 80 - 90 km/h on the expressway in the middle lane.   Regenerative Braking  \\r\\nUnlike some other EVs like the Hyundai Kona or MG ZS EV, you cannot adjust the level of regenerative braking in the Tigor EV. That sucks as we\\'d like the option to select, depending on the driving condition or individual preferences. There\\x92s just one standard level of regenerative braking and it is quite mild compared to other EVs. Tata says they have kept it mild based on feedback from Nexon owners and for a smoother drive experience. Can\\x92t argue with that; regen does take getting used to, especially if it\\'s aggressive. Tata has provided a regen meter on the instrument cluster with 6 bars to show you how much energy you are regenerating. The maximum regeneration that we saw under heavy braking is 4 bars worth.  \\r\\nAgain, we really wish Tata gave adjustable regen levels in the Tigor EV, as enthusiasts who like engine-braking in ICE cars usually prefer the higher regen settings. On the highest setting, you can also do one-pedal driving in many situations. Plus, aggressive regen can be used to maximise range.   Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) \\r\\nWell, there\\x92s no engine noise for starters! The only sound coming is a faint whirring by the electric motor. No gearshifts & minimal mechanical parts mean no jerks or vibrations. On the highway, tyre noise starts creeping into the cabin early at 80 km/h. You\\'ll hear it more because there is no engine sound to drown some of it out.   Range \\r\\nRange anxiety is a big concern with EVs. However, it\\x92s only when you are pushing the car hard that you\\'ll notice the range and battery percentage falling at a rapid pace. The ARAI-certified range for the Tigor EV under standard test conditions is 306 km, but under normal driving conditions, you can expect a range of ~200 km. 200 km is enough for those intending to drive primarily in the city.   Charging \\r\\nTata Motors has been working with its sister company, Tata Power, to improve the charging infrastructure levels. There were about 60 Tata charging stations in January 2020. The number has grown to 640 this August.  \\r\\nThat said, we can tell you that the best place to charge your EV is at home. Cheapest + most convenient. At an average cost of Rs. 8 per unit, you\\x92ll be paying Rs. 208 for a full tank at home.  \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets a CCS Type 2 charging port, which is currently the standard for electric vehicles in India. The estimated charging time from 0-80% from a 15A plug point is about 8 hours & 45 minutes. A 25 kW DC fast charger can charge the batteries to 80% in 65 minutes. For a DC fast charger, you will have to pay ~Rs. 18-20 per unit. So a full tank would be Rs. 520 in just over an hour.  Suspension    Ride Comfort \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam dual-path strut suspension at the rear. It rides on 14-inch rims shod with 175/65 section tyres. The recommended tyre pressure rating is 33 PSI at the front and 38 PSI at the rear. This makes sense as the battery pack has been placed directly above the rear suspension.  \\r\\nLike most fossil fuel cars converted to electric, the Tigor EV\\'s suspension has been stiffened up due to the heavy battery pack it is carrying. You\\'ll notice the firmer suspension as soon as you start driving the car. Over some mildly uneven roads in the city at slow speeds, there is a fair bit of movement in the cabin and it even feels jiggly at times. You feel more of the road in the Tigor EV, but still, ride quality is liveable & compliant enough on most city roads. It\\'s only the really big bumps that come in strong, as do the sharp road dips. On the other hand, the Tigor EV rides rather flat on the expressway.   Handling & Dynamics \\r\\nThere are a couple of things that aid the handling characteristics of the Tigor EV. Firstly, it\\x92s the firmer suspension and secondly, the heavy mechanicals (battery pack + motor) that lower the centre of gravity. High-speed stability is very good and you\\x92ll be doing 110 - 120 km/h on the expressway without feeling nervous at all.  \\r\\nGet on some twisty roads and you\\x92ll appreciate the stiffer suspension. The car feels agile and you can carry good speed into corners. The suspension setup does complement the chassis well and the Tigor EV holds its line nicely by family sedan standards. Changing direction on back-to-back corners is no problem either. Earlier, I had apprehensions that the heavy battery pack at the rear might cause some imbalance, but we didn\\'t face any problem on our (admittedly) limited test drive. The only issue is the 175/65 section rubber which is meant for maximizing range and not for pushing hard into corners. On a particularly wet day outside Mumbai, the only factors keeping us from driving the car aggressively on curvy roads were the tyres and the alarmingly fast depletion of the battery charge! Yes, the battery level drops rapidly if you drive like a BHPian.   Steering \\r\\nThe electric power-assisted steering is a nice unit and is super light at parking speeds. The turning radius of 5.1m is user-friendly and you can manoeuvre the car easily with gentle inputs on the steering. It weighs up adequately as you gain speed. However, the EPS is dead and there\\x92s not much feel or feedback from it.   Braking \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. Their performance, in general, is satisfactory. However, we feel that wider tyres would definitely improve the braking performance of the car. Another sore point is that, like most EVs, the brake pedal has a spongy & rubbery feel. It feels weird at first.', \"Tata Tigor EV Exterior Images\\nThe Tigor EV is based on the Tigor Facelift and gets a few changes to the exterior that announce it as an electric car. Changes to the front include a different grille and air dam design:  \\nThe rear hasn’t changed much even from the original Tigor. Changes include redesigned tail-lamps, a tweaked bumper & no tail-pipe :  \\nIn profile, the 14-inch wheels shod with 175/65 section tyres look a size too small on the Tigor EV, especially since the regular Tigor XZ+ variant gets nice-looking 15-inch alloy wheels. But then, because the suspension has been firmed up, these 14-inchers + taller sidewalls are better from the ride quality POV than the 15s:  \\nThe Tigor EV measures 3,993 mm in length, 1,677 mm in width and 1,532 mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2,450 mm:  \\nGoing electric means the Tigor has put on ~200 kg. The additional weight had to be balanced by a stiffer suspension that has also led to the ground clearance going up by 2 mm (172 mm):  \\nThe solid front grille gets a single opening in the middle with the characteristic tri-arrow design at either end. The trim below the grille is finished in blue for the Tigor EV:  \\nProjector headlamps were introduced in the Tigor Facelift. They’re offered only on the top-end XZ+ variant:  \\nA closer look at the tri-arrow design and the EV badging on the grille:  \\nThe air dam at the bottom has a nice mesh-like design with the same tri-arrow detailing. Also, check out the sharp design on the lip:  \\nFoglamp housings also get the blue EV touch. LED DRLs are placed next to the foglamps:  \\nThe blue insert below the grille was misaligned in our car. Not cool, Tata! You really need to get your build right. The ORVM glasses of a demo that GTO drove were shaking & vibrating on bad roads:  \\nA look at the underbody from the front. Being an EV, we would’ve expected the Tigor to have a healthy amount of underbody protection, but it doesn't:   \\nPlenty of EV badging to let you know this Tigor is different:  \\nORVM covers are finished in black for this dual-tone variant:  \\nAll 4 door handles get chrome treatment. The driver's door gets a request sensor:  \\n14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers that make them look like alloy wheels. The blue accent on the wheel cover is a neat touch:  \\nThe black roof looks great on the Tigor EV; the premium one has to pay for the dual-tone variant is ~Rs. 15,000:  \\nSmart & tight rear. An EV badge on the top right, a Ziptron badge on the bottom right & a blue strip on the bumper will tell you it's the battery-powered variant:  \\nAlways loved the design of the spoiler-integrated HMSL of the Tigor. What’s new is the sharkfin antenna on top:  \\nA closer look at the clear lens tail-lamp. Very smart. You get LED elements in the split tail-lamp design:  \\nYou get a single reversing light on the left and two reflectors. The light next to the RHS reflector is a dummy. Not done, we wish there were two reversing lights:  \\nLook underneath and you will see the battery pack, just behind the rear suspension:  \\nBattery specifications are mentioned on the battery itself. Look at the weight of the battery pack. 165 kilos!  \\nThese orange high voltage cables are a sore sight. In road conditions like ours, these wires should definitely have been better protected & concealed: \", 'Tata Tigor EV Interior Images\\r\\nWhile the interiors are largely similar to the standard Tigor, there are a few \"EV\" touches in the cabin. The new flat-bottom steering wheel of the Tigor Facelift is good to hold. What\\x92s even nicer is that it is soft:  \\r\\nButtons for the audio system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. A useful mute function has been provided (long press to mute). Notice the small horn symbol (next to steering buttons on both sides) - extended horn-pad! The plastic on the spokes doesn\\x92t feel very premium. Should\\x92ve gotten the piano black treatment like in the Tiago NRG (reference image):  \\r\\nFully digital instrument cluster gets a blue EV highlight around it. The meter on the left shows how much power is being used (dependent on the accelerator input, similar to an ICE-car\\'s rpm counter). You have a battery level indicator on the top right and below that, you get the Regen meter (6 bars). The screen in the middle displays the speed, charge level, transmission mode, distance to empty etc.:  \\r\\nAir vents get some blue love too:  \\r\\nThe dual-tone theme from the dashboard continues to the door pad. The area above the armrest gets a fabric insert which is a welcome touch:  \\r\\nEV-specific seat upholstery gets contrast blue stitching. The driver\\'s seat is adjustable for height:  \\r\\nA closer look at the fabric upholstery:  \\r\\nPeople with a big shoe size might find the pedals placed too close to each other. Pedal travel is on the shorter side. You get a well-sized dead pedal to rest your foot. Notice the exposed wiring above the pedals:  \\r\\nGood to see the \"fuel\" flap release lever marked properly!!!  \\r\\nThe 7-inch Harman touchscreen is basic, yet packs all the features that you would need from a touchscreen. The home screen gets a split display and the touchscreen overall is pretty convenient to use, with very little lag:  \\r\\nThe car gets 4 speakers and 4 tweeters which have the usual audio adjustments. Sound quality is good by compact sedan standards. You also have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Touchscreen doubles up as a display for the reversing camera, which gets adaptive guidelines:  \\r\\nThe Tigor EV offers iRA connected car technology, which includes features like intrusion alert, remote immobilization, geofencing, time fencing, remote door lock/unlock, remote cooling, remote vehicle diagnostics, trip analytics etc.:  \\r\\nThe button next to the foglamp switch is to lock the charger (to prevent theft). Say you are charging the car overnight in the parking lot, pressing the button locks/unlocks the charger from the port:  \\r\\nThe rotary gear shifter has 4 modes - R, N, D & S. We wish there was a \"P\" (park) mode that would lock the car in place. There is a gap between the desired gear being selected and the drive mode actually being engaged. This will get to you while executing three-point turns:  \\r\\nA look at the rear bench seat with the new upholstery:  \\r\\nWith the front seat adjusted to my height of 5\\'10\", I had just about enough legroom. The recline angle is comfortable and the under-thigh support is satisfactory. There are more spacious competitors though:  \\r\\nThe 316-litre boot. Spare tyre chews away space. This is without the charging cable in place:  \\r\\nNo cladding on the inside of the boot lid. The pre-facelift Tigor had it (reference image):  \\r\\nSpare is a full-size tyre (175/65 R14) on a steel wheel:  \\r\\nLift up the boot floor and you will see the top of the battery pack: ', \"We visited the Tata Power charging station at the Tata dealership in Nerul, Navi Mumbai. There were CCS + CHA charging ports. The CHA type charging port was used for the previous Tigor EV. The current generation of EVs (Nexon & Tigor) use the CCS type 2 charger:  \\r\\nHere\\x92s a look at the plug for the CCS type 2 DC fast charger:  \\r\\nTo charge the Tigor EV, you\\x92ll have to install the Tata EZ Charge app. The app displays all the charging stations close to you. When you tap on a particular station, it will show the type of charging ports available at the station. Once you have selected the station, you can choose the type of charging \\x96 amount, units of charge, time for a charge & percentage of the charge. The app will then show the amount you have to pay. You can plug in the charger and wait. The overall process is quite easy and even a first-time user won\\x92t have any issues navigating through the app:   \\r\\nThe 25 kW DC fast charger at a Tata Power unit takes ~65 minutes to charge the battery from 0-80%. At a Tata Power unit, a unit of charge (kWh) costs Rs. 18. Some third-party charging stations charge up to Rs. 20 for the same. That's far more expensive than charging at home. The unit displays how much time is left according to your selection of units:  \\r\\nA blue indicator light comes on when you plug in the charger, and a green indicator starts glowing when the charging begins:  \\r\\nThe 15A charger that you get with the car takes ~8 hours and 45 minutes to charge the batteries from 0-80%. Best to charge it overnight (at home) or when parked at the office (during the day): \", 'The Tigor EV was better than I expected. The on-paper stats had me believe that it will be underpowered, but that\\'s not the case. While the drive in D is ordinary (it\\'s more like ECO mode or a 1.2L NA petrol), \"S\" was sufficiently peppy. I had a good long drive on the highway. \"D\" should easily give you about 200 km range which is sufficient for a city commuter, but with a heavy foot in \"S\" mode, I took the range down from 228 -> 80 km after driving ~110 km.  \\nI\\'m very proud that Tata has snatched the first-mover advantage away from Mahindra, and is selling this world-class technology at attainable prices while Maruti sells 20-year old 4-speed AT gearboxes, Honda still keeps harping about its \"Yo Vtec\" technology from the 1990s and VW-Skoda couldn\\'t even make their 1.5L Diesel BS6 compliant. In the midst of these outdated / lazy approaches comes Tata offering cutting-edge tech .  \\nThere is a certain sense of pride driving a green number-plate car & other road users do respect you. No denying the camaraderie among EV owners either. Came across this Nexon EV and all of its occupants excitedly waved at me as if I\\'m a long lost cousin.

Do we know if the battery is water cooled? The more ideal the temperature of the battery pack, the better it is for long term. As it stands, the long term battery degradation is still an unknown for Tata. Was the range with A/C on? And if it was, what was it with the A/C off, if checked?', 'I think this is a desperate attempt to flog a dead car and in meantime, grab eyeballs and attention while the actually relevant Altroz EV gets ready. Tigor wasn’t anyone’s favourite child to begin with. And nobody is going to touch a Tata car which Tata itself sells as a taxi. The product may be decent in isolation but it’s a Tigor at the end of the day. A 7-8 lakh rupee car priced in the WagonR-Swift-Ignis range. Who is going to buy a Tigor for 13L?', \"What a wonderful review. Rating it five stars.  \\nExcellent to see Tata make such a fast move (compared to their peers) in the EV space. Tells a lot of their focus and how they are definitely trying to have the first mover advantage before Tesla (and probably the rest of the global players following them) drops in India to take the premium EV section. Which probably will be a lot of the initial customer base of Tata EV cars. \\n------------------------------------ \\nAs for the review, request a few more areas to be considered wrt to such EV reviews if possible. I can think of a few below - probably other potential buyers could chip in further \\n- a current view on the charging network. Would be extremely useful to folks like me who are and will be on the fence for the next few years to understand how the manufacturer based and 3rd party charging infrastructure is developing  \\n- Potential niggles and worries wrt to EV wear & tear. Those exposed wiring (especially under the car) feel a bit more dangerous wrt to external elements - say rat biting. What would be the potential scenarios of such cases - just a non-working car or even more damage/risk? Does the EV car warranty cover such scenarios given we no longer have a ICE engine under the hood now?  \\n- Any views on additional insurance cover. ICE cars would have engine cover (or similar terminology) to provide additional cover to what's under the hood.

With this launch, Tata is just stamping their image as market leaders in EV segment, in the minds of the customers. \\r\\nWith Nexon, Tigor and Altroz done, I foresee that the Harrier will be next car to get the EV Treatment. Safari will most probably not get it as a limited range EV really doesnt resonate with the explorer nature / positioning of Safari. \\r\\nGo Tata!  \\r\\nAlso, anyone has the on-road pricing list for different states? This subsidy thing is really difficult to grasp currently (due to lack of awareness).', 'Excellent review covering all the details. Tigor EV does not makes much of a sense as Nexon EV is sitting just a couple of lakhs away with a perceived better range. Also what Tata could have done is priced Tigor at starting 9L which could have translated it into an affordable option compared to Nexon. But kudos to Tata for atleast giving decent offerings in electric range as well. \\r\\nI wonder where they would pitch in the Altroz EV if Tigor is priced at 11.99L. There are also rumours of Altroz getting more range than even Nexon.', \"Good. Feels like a trailer for better things to come! \\nAltroz will be real deal. Hope they stick in same powerplant as Nexon in it and don't treat it step-motherly. Also great move by Tata.

Hydrogen fuel cell cars are also gaining traction globally and we might see them here too in the times to come. Technology adoption has become the name of the game and those who won't play by the rules would slowly but surely perish. \\r\\nHowever, India is a highly price sensitive market and the 'Kitna Deti Hai' factor is a big contributor to purchasing decisions. So I just did a high level calculation of whether it would make financial sense to go for a car like the new Tigor EV over a similar ICE model and if it does, how much does the owner really stand to benefit over the lifecycle of the vehicle taken to be 15 years here, with an average running of 1500 kms a month.   \\r\\nThese are just ballpark figures but it can be clearly deduced that EVs save in a good amount of money overall. Adding cherry to the cake are the government subsidies and the additional income tax benefits which I haven't even accounted for in these calculations. \\r\\nFor someone requiring a car only for city commutes, EVs make a lot of sense. They are zippy, fun to drive, and save a lot of money while being so. Charge them at home overnight and you are good to go the next day or maybe even two days. They have their limitations as of now but the benefits definitely far exceed those limitations. \\r\\nPeople using a car for regular/ frequent long highway runs and people living in areas facing long and frequent power cuts should wait for some more time before the public charging infrastructure adequately covers major parts of the country and the cost of using such infrastructure also comes down. \\r\\nTo sum it up, we are headed in the right direction; an ecosystem where power is generated utilising an optimum mix of renewable and non-renewable sources and consumption is reduced through use of highly energy efficient products and services.\", \"Tata deserves all the praise for bringing out 'usable' EVs to the masses.

I am not sure how many of us have that kind of running and in this case we are talking about an EV with a rather limited real world range!

It's been delayed as we hardly use the car as of now, due to CoViD. But now I need to take a decision, and I have considered the following three offerings - MG ZS EV Excite, Nexon EV XZ+ & now the Tigor EV XZ+. I loved the MG ZS EV by the way, it felt like a perfect electric car! But after giving it a lot of thought, I may pick the Tigor EV, and here are my reasons - \\r\\n1) ICE vs BEV: For me, cost of ownership comparisons with ICE cars does not make sense (it's not always numbers!). I am in the market only for EVs, we need to switch as soon as possible ... \\r\\n2) Cost & Tech: I totally agree that EVs are still maturing, and I didn't want to put in a lot of money and end up with outdated technology in a very short span of 3 years. So this makes me hesitant towards picking the ZS EV \\r\\n3) Performance: Considering my current car, performance in Tigor EV seems just enough for me, going by the reviews. So, I won't miss the Nexon EV in this aspect \\r\\n4) Range: I will mostly use it in the city, with weekend drives to places under 80 km - a total drive of 150 km to 180 km.\\r\\nRange wise ZS EV is far ahead, but again you pay for it accordingly. Between Nexon & Tigor, looks like Nexon isn't giving a lot more (considering the 3 lakh+ additional on-road price for XZ+ including insurance) - please correct me, if you think Nexon gives us considerably more range. \\r\\n5) Safety: Here Nexon seems better, but again Tigor EV was at least crash tested (unlike Nexon EV), and it's probably ok to go with a 4 Star rated car (for child passengers with restraint, Nexon scores 3 stars, while Tigor gets 4 stars). I would be more confident though, if it was tested from the rear too, considering the battery is on the rear. \\r\\nSo, putting in 3 lakh less than Nexon EV, I get range close to it, with performance and tech that I find satisfactory - so Tigor EV it is!! And I hope I can make this my second car in 3 years or so when higher range batteries and technology become more affordable.\", 'I feel the Altroz would have been a better candidate for \\'EV conversion\\' - a well liked car like the Nexon.

Further where electricity is in short supply in most parts (witness DG sets and consequent pollution by them all over) should it not be used for its core purposes rather than mobility. What is the use to run DG set to produce electricity to charge an EV. \\n We have not even got around to proper recycling of lead acid batteries yet - lead is now ingrained almost everywhere in India. How will we treat toxic components of these new batteries - lithium, cadmium, polymers, etc. A lot of regulations over this must be brought in. \\nLast I checked Mumbai domestic electricity rates are way above Rs. 8/unit. 8.77+1.44+0.26. Add another 16% as duty on the whole. Comes to around 12-13/unit. Add 10-15% charging efficiency loss will actually be around Rs 15/unit. This is without FAC charges. These are a lot lower currently than in the past. That is why TATA fast charging costs Rs. 18-20/unit. It is actually just at cost. In some countries now EV running costs are actually higher than normal ICE car. That being said a lot of states offer lower rates for EVs so it is not easy to generalise. \\nAnother aspect is low running - whether charge/re-charge cycles or time - just like tires/oil, batteries also deteriorate over time whether you use or not. \\nAnother macro aspect is the economy.

With the atleast 2,50,000 INR incentives by states and a flat 1,50,000 INR tax rebate by Income Tax, the price comes down to 9 Lacs for the top end variant, which is a deal breaker, specially in cities wherein you have heavy traffic, your left foot needs rest, petrol is 100+ and you have the option to charge your car in the office/home campus.

So we would need 2 cars in the houshold. Then we were planning to get rid of the 4 year old Maruti Swift with almost 70,000 km on the odo and buy a new car. My mother was sure she wanted a bigger car and really liked the C-SUVs. Thus started my search for 2 cars to be bought, without creating too big a hole in the pocket both in terms of the cost of the cars as well as the regular running costs. \\r\\nWe ended up buying the Nexon Petrol XZ+ in December 2020 (took 4 months for delivery as we bought it via the GoI portal as my mom works in a PSU). This was a manual and both my mom and then gf clamoured that the other car should be an automatic. Within a month of driving the Nexon, I realised that this is not anywhere near efficient as the Swift which returned 13-14kmpl in the city and 16-18kmpl in the highway!  The Nexon was returning about 8-9kmpl in the city (especially in the hands of our driver) and about 14kmpl on the highway. \\r\\nHere is the Nexon during our Mumbai to Kanyakumari drive.    \\r\\nWe figured out a budget of about 6-7Lakhs for the second car. Considering my fuel bill from the Nexon, Petrol was a no go. Diesel Automatics in the new car segment were all going way beyond my budget. So looked at the used car market. I checked out some 15 cars from Cars24, Olx, Facebook Marketplace etc., however, none were either fitting the bill or would help with the lowering of the running costs which we hoped for. This made me look at EVs as an alternative, considering they would also comply with the demand for an automatic car and are usually frugal to run. I checked some less run (<15000 km on the odo) E2Os and E2O+. None were in a good shape and the prices being quoted seemed very high. Then, while going through Facebook Marketplace and OLX, I ended up contacting some folks in Nashik, who had bought some 20 eVeritos in auction from Mahindra itself. I bargained to buy an eVerito for 4.8L from the guy. We bought the car in March\\'21. This car had 120km of range and was just about adequate for the city drives.\\r\\nHere is the Mahindra eVerito. Yes I had added some stickers to make it look less like a white taxi.   \\r\\nWe used the car for about 11 months and covered 12,000kms on it. In that time I was convinced that an EV was perfect as a second car in the family, especially for city usage.  \\r\\nWith the Nexon EV gaining in popularity, Tata Power went on a war footing to set up EV chargers everywhere and even smaller companies like Statiq, etc were setting up chargers. BUT, they were all CCS2 type chargers and the eVerito, being a 72V system could only accept GBT type charger for fast charging. This made the eVerito obsolete. The eVerito did its part to convince me completely to buy an EV next time I bought a car, especially as a second car in the house. \\r\\nIn August\\'21 when Tata launched the Tigor, I was smitten by it. My best friend in Kolkata had a Tiago and I had driven it enough to know that for a city car it was more than adequate. The Tigor was the same chassis with the added boot space. \\r\\nI went to get a test drive for the Tigor the very next day, however, none of the Tata showrooms in Mumbai had a Tigor test drive vehicle (they said that all the test drive vehicles were on media drive duties after launch for 1 week)\\r\\nSo I ended up test driving the Nexon EV. And boy was I impressed! It was way better than the eVerito which I was driving and felt like a different class! On checking the prices, I realised that even post the subsidies being offered, I would need to shell out close to 15L. This was an absolute no go! Not to be disheartened, I booked myself for a test drive at the Puneet showroom in Prabhadevi (where I knew the folks considering they had delivered my Nexon) for the next week when the tigor would be available.  \\r\\nThe test drive car had about 1300km on the odo. I loved the experience. It had all the ingredients of the Nexon EV, but in a smaller package. All 3 of us took turns to test drive the car and even though we were not looking to buy a car, were quite convinced that we should replace the eVerito with the Tigor EV!  \\r\\nIn the meantime, Maharashtra Government announced the EV subsidy scheme and the early bird scheme. We calculated that if we bought the Tigor before end of December\\'21, we would end up with 2.3L as a subsidy. This along with the fact that we were getting almost 4.5L for the eVerito (this is the time when the cost of petrol hit 100 for the first time and people were looking for EVs), convinced us that we should sell the eVerito and buy the Tigor EV. \\r\\nExperience of Ownership- \\r\\nWe took delivery of the car on 3rd February 2022. It costed us exactly 11Lon road post all the subsidies and dealer level discounts.   \\r\\nThe same week we took delivery of the Tigor, we decided to do a trip to Alibaug. This was the first time I was taking an EV outside Mumbai, so I decided to completely plan the trip. I made a note of all the charging stations along the way (there were none post Navi Mumbai) and even kept a note of the Tata dealer nearest from Alibaug in case I needed help in terms of getting towed if I got stuck without charge somewhere. The distance to the resort from my place in Mumbai was showing 120km and I knew that if I drove in a sedate manner, I would be able to reach and come back to Navi Mumbai and charge somewhere. Thankfully we were able to charge at the resort itself. Thus began the Tigor EV journey for my family. \\r\\nSo, the Tigor EV will deliver about 180-220km of range no matter how you drive (unless you decide to thrash it around in Sports mode) in the city or on the highway. It takes 7-8hrs to charge via a 15amps socket. Mostly we drive the Tigor in the city and a once a month trip to Pune which come to about 400km( 300km to and fro and some running within Pune). \\r\\nJust to put into context the cost savings one can get from an EV- a round trip to Pune costs us about INR1100 (INR 630 tolls and about INR450-500 for charging the car on slow charger at both Mumbai and Pune overnight). In the Nexon petrol it would cost us something like INR 3800-4000 (considering 14kmpl average, 30liters of Petrol and rest 630 toll). Thats like 1/3rd the cost if not lesser. When compared to my Nexon, its like saving INR10 for every km I drive the Tigor EV vis a vis my Nexon. This has meant that the Nexon is only used when we end up going for our once in a quarter long drive. \\r\\nIn my 8 months and about 12,000km experience of the Tigor EV, here are the positives- \\r\\n1. The drive on the Tigor is silent, plaint and comfortable.\\r\\n2. The Harman sourced music system is very good in terms of the music quality, barely average in terms of the touch screen. \\r\\n3. No issues in going through the \"roads\" of Mumbai post monsoon. Suspension is quite sorted, supple.\\r\\n4. Power delivery is just as it should be on an EV- Instant. To put it into perspective, the 74bhp is not a lot, but the car can easily be driven at 90kmph on the expressway and it feels extremely stable. The torque is brilliant and the traffic light \"its lights off and away we go\" race sessions are quite enjoyable.\\r\\n5. In my humble opinion, you get 2 cars in the Tigor EV- one sedate and well mannered one when the car is in D mode and another crazy unexpected car when in S mode. They feel like poles apart. I tried to drive the car in an enthusiastic manner in S mode for a full day, it lasted me 89km and the battery was at 22%. So if you want to extract range, you need to be sedate\\r\\n6. Sound isolation in the Tigor EV is average, however you will feel a certain calm in it, even in the hustle and bustle of city life\\r\\n7. The car delivers 200km of range in most use cases within the city, which with an average commute of 30km/day would last a whole week before one needs to recharge \\r\\nHeres the photo of the odo when I completed 10,000kms!     \\r\\nIn the last 8 months, I have observed the following in terms of issues- \\r\\n1. Do not believe the range shown on the console. It completely depends on how you have driven in the last 15mins/ 5kms. Look at the below image, its next to impossible that a car with 26kWh battery gives that much range with ~70% battery remaining. One should instead look at the wh/km reading and try and keep that below 120 and you are good to go. Better caliberation should be done in the range displayed.    \\r\\n2. The Air condition system on the Tigor EV is faulty. It just never works when you need it to. Its not just my experience. I am a part of a group of more than 200 Tigor EV owners from all over India and almost 70% of us have faced some or the other issue with the AC. In my case, it worked perfectly till the 2nd free service at 7000km, since then the AC stops working if the ambient temperature goes above 30-32C and when you need it the most. Even when the AC works, its absolutely not adequate.  \\r\\n3. Fit and Finish issues- There are rattles from B and C pillars which start appearing every time one goes through a pothole riddled road. Being an EV, these rattles are even more prominent and irksome. The only way to solve this is to open up the internal panels and shut them up tight with a few hits. \\r\\n4. The Tigor EV cannot be fast charged at all types of Fast chargers, even those on the Tata Power EZ charge app. This is a major concern as one might have planned to juice up at a particular charger and the car wont accept the charge. I believe this can be rectified via some software updates. \\r\\n5. The Z connect App which Tata provides often times does not work or even if it works, shows wrong information. Also, it beats me as to how a company which has a tech giant like TCS as a sister company can have such glitches-     \\r\\n6. The absence of different modes of regeneration and Cruise control are a big miss in the Tigor EV. EVs like ICE cars work most efficiently when driven at a constant speed. Efficiency is even more critical in an EV as it may mean the difference of 2-3km can decide whether you could reach your destination or got stranded midway. Hopefully Tata will provide these with an update like that in the case of the Nexon EV users.  \\r\\nOverall, I am extremely happy with the car as is my family. Its a very good car for the city. The Tigor EV is comfortable, well spec\\'ed and delivers a decent range for daily city usage and planned highway usage.     ', 'Thank you for a well detailed review. I am seriously considering buying an EV, reviews like these are most useful. I have a few followup questions for you, would be great if you can answer them.

Thanks to him for the expert observations and photography! \", 'Review Index: Exterior  Interior - Front  Interior - Rear  In-Car Entertainment  Battery, Range & Charging  Driving the Kona Electric  Other Points  Smaller yet Significant Things', 'Exterior  \\r\\nSince the launch of the Reva electric car in 2001, only a sparse handful of electric vehicles have made an appearance in the Indian market. However, none of them have garnered as much attention as the Hyundai Kona. Unlike all the electric cars offered in India until now, the Kona is a well-rounded and internationally established product, provides an extremely high driving range, is available to private owners and isn\\x92t ridiculously overpriced. Hyundai says that they are trying to capitalize by \\x93combining two of the fastest growing trends in the auto market - SUVs + electrification\\x94. Mind you, we\\x92d consider this a crossover rather than an SUV, but that seems to just be the nomenclature these days. Any manufacturer making inroads into the electric car market at such a nascent stage also has to do the hard work of setting up the infrastructure, as well as battling the stigmas and concerns associated with electric cars (related thread: Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head). It\\x92s not an easy or financially rewarding first move, but respect to Hyundai for being a pioneer here. Since Maruti hasn\\x92t done it yet, there\\x92s no one better than India\\x92s #2 manufacturer to kick things off. \\r\\nBeing an electric car, the Kona is more expensive than equivalent fuel-powered cars. This leaves us with two ways to look at the situation. Either we compare the Kona with other cars in the same price bracket, or we compare the Kona to equivalent sized & spec\\x92d cars, and simply write-off the price difference as an \\x93EV premium\\x94.  For example, cars like the A-Class, Beetle, Fiat 500 and the Mini Cooper are priced much higher compared to what they offer size & feature wise. But they sell anyway due to fulfilling a particular niche need (looks, design, status). The Kona will do the same, fulfilling the need of being sustainable & environmentally friendly. There are a lot of buyers who are eager to buy an electric car and don\\x92t mind paying a premium, but just haven\\x92t had an option to pick so far. There hasn\\'t been much to choose from apart from the ridiculously priced Prius, toy-car e2o, much higher-priced Camry Hybrid, etc. Hyundai says they hope to fill this niche, and predict sales of 500 units per annum for the Kona in India. \\r\\nIn the international market, Hyundai offers the Kona in two battery capacities - 39 kWh and 64 kWh. In India, Hyundai decided to offer only the 39 kWh version to keep the costs down. In the UK, the price difference between the two variants is around GBP 4,125. This would have made the 64 kWh version of the Kona Electric cost roughly Rs. 4 lakh more than the current car. The 64 kWh offers a lot more range as well as a higher power output. Would Kona customers be willing to pay that extra amount for an additional ~190 km of range, especially given the extreme scarcity of EV charging points in India? Perhaps a warm welcome for the Kona in India would have Hyundai considering bringing in the 64 kWh version in the future. \\r\\nAnother point to note is that the only variant on sale in India is actually the middle variant in the international Kona Electric line-up. Our variant is still well loaded, but we do lose out on a few top-end features like a larger 8\" AVN display, HUD, Autonomous Emergency Braking, etc. \\r\\nComing to safety, the Kona is equipped with dual front airbags, side and curtain airbags, ABS + EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, impact-sensitive door locks, tyre pressure monitoring system, seatbelt reminder (for driver + front passenger) and a high speed alert system. It also gets a burglar alarm, ESC, VSM, HAC and a reverse camera with dynamic guidelines. Being an electric vehicle, the Kona comes with a Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS) that when switched on generates a humming noise while the car is in motion. The EU mandates that all electric vehicles should be fitted with a similar device to audibly warn pedestrians and cyclists.  \\r\\nHyundai is offering a standard warranty of 3 years / unlimited km, which can be extended to 5 years / 1,40,000 km. We strongly recommend this extension, especially considering that this is Hyundai\\'s first electric car in India. Hyundai is also offering 3 years Road Side Assistance with the Kona, and a standard 8 years / 1,60,000 km warranty on the battery. \\r\\nUnlike the fuel-powered Kona that\\x92s sold aboard, the electric variant gets a sealed off grille, and this makes it stand out from all the conventional cars on the road. While many may not like this design, I did. No grille also means minimal usage of chrome, which is a plus:  \\r\\nThe rear gets a split light design with the taillights & brake lights at the top, and the indicators, reversing light & rear fog lamp below. The lower part of the bumper is also finished in black plastic cladding. Use of chrome is limited to the badges. The Kona measures 1,800 mm in width and 1,570 mm in height:  \\r\\nFrom the side, it\\'s apparent that this advertised \\'SUV\\' is clearly more like a crossover / hatchback. The cladding helps make it look more SUV-ish. However, it\\x92s evident that the main selling points of an SUV - height and ground clearance, don\\'t really feature on this car. Even the watchman at BIC expressed his concern about the ground clearance looking a little low for Indian roads. The Kona\\'s length is 4,180 mm, while the wheelbase is 2,600 mm:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets a lot of features designed to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Hyundai says that the co-efficient of drag for the vehicle is 0.29:  \\r\\nBuild quality is good but not like the European cars - there are some odd panel gaps. The paint job is very good as well, but not excellent. Look closely and you might notice the orange-peel effect:  \\r\\nSomething else that is becoming a trend nowadays is the bifurcation of the DRLs from the headlamp cluster. The 5-pod LED DRLs and indicators are placed above, while the headlights are placed below:  \\r\\nLook closely and you will find this small protrusion on the DRL cluster lens:  \\r\\nThe bright and prominent DRLs make the front end look more aggressive:  \\r\\nThe headlight cluster in the bumper gets auto-on auto-leveling bi-functional LED headlamps and cornering lamps which activate when the front wheels are turned:  \\r\\nHere\\'s a look at the headlight (white) and the cornering light (yellow) in action:  \\r\\nA closer look at the debossed \\x91+\\x92 motif on the grille. This will be difficult to keep clean. The front also has a silver-grey trim running the full width of the car below the DRLs and the bonnet line:  \\r\\nA round warning light in the Hyundai logo indicates the status of the Aux. Battery Saver+, which monitors the charging status of the 12V auxiliary battery. When the indicator is illuminated, Hyundai says that touching the high voltage electric wire (orange), connector and all electric components could cause an electric shock leading to injuries:  \\r\\nThe charging port is located behind this flap on the front grille. In case of a frontal collision, the charging port could get damaged easily. We would have preferred the charging port placed elsewhere on the vehicle. The cover for the charging port gets a logo which smartly integrates the icon of a plug, as well as the letter \\'E\\'. In order to open the charging port, put the car in P, switch the car off, and press the flap near the \\'E\\' to open it. It can only be opened when the vehicle is unlocked:  \\r\\nThe dual tone bumper gets black plastic cladding at the bottom. Also notice the wind deflector down below:  \\r\\nThe front bumper also gets active air flaps that can open and close as required:  \\r\\nThree small slits on the left side of the bumper. We were told they were for additional airflow to internal components:  \\r\\nAir vents are present on both extreme ends of the bumper:  \\r\\nThe front towing point is hidden behind this cut-out:  \\r\\nUnderbody protection has been provided at the front. Due to the position of the battery pack, the underside of the Kona is extremely flat:  \\r\\nThe bonnet has muscular bulges and creases that add to the aggressive look of the front end:  \\r\\nThe creases on the bonnet are clearly visible here:  \\r\\nORVMs are electrically adjustable and auto-folding. They unfold as soon as you approach the locked car with the key in your pocket:  \\r\\nBoth the front doors get request sensors:  \\r\\nCharacter lines on the doors and the flared rear wheel arches add to the crossover / SUV look of the Kona:  \\r\\nThe doors get plastic cladding at the bottom, as well as a silver trim highlight:  \\r\\nRear quarter-glass area is too small to make a noticeable difference:  \\r\\nC-pillars get plastic inserts and three small aero fins at the tail end:  \\r\\nBend down and you\\'ll see that the battery pack hangs down below the door sills, compromising the ground clearance:  \\r\\nIt\\x92s unclear how much underbody protection there is for the battery pack. Hopefully, our notorious Indian roads won\\x92t create any problems here:  \\r\\nBlue Drive badging on the front fender:  \\r\\nBlack plastic cladding runs along the wheel arches. 17\" inch alloy wheels are shod with 215/55 Nexen N\\'Fera SU1 tyres. The alloy wheel design is unusual and may not be to everyone\\'s tastes:  \\r\\nUpon closer investigation, you\\'ll find that the darker colored-inserts are made out of plastic. These could be to aid aerodynamic efficiency without adding much more weight:  \\r\\nThe wheel arches get these clear reflectors on both sides:  \\r\\nThe rear wheel arches also get plastic cladding, which continues toward the rear and wraps around the lower part of the tail lights too:  \\r\\nLook closely through the plastic inserts and you\\'ll find rear disc brakes:  \\r\\nSomething that Indian customers like - the Kona gets a sunroof:  \\r\\nThe crossover also gets black roof rails and a stubby antenna, which sits at the rear of the roof. A shark-fin antenna would have looked a lot more modern here:  \\r\\nTailgate gets a neatly integrated spoiler, which houses an LED HMSL. The tiny cut-out touching the glass is for the rear washer:  \\r\\nThe rear gets LED tail lamps:  \\r\\nA look at the tail lights in action:  \\r\\nA rear washer and wiper are offered:  \\r\\nNumber plate is housed in a large recessed area on the tailgate. Do note that a large chrome strip has NOT been slapped on above it:  \\r\\nReversing camera is tucked away, above the number plate with the soft-touch boot release button next to it:  \\r\\nThe only chrome bits on the tailgate are the \\'Kona\\' badging on the left...  \\r\\n...and the \\'electric\\' badging on the right:  \\r\\nDual-tone rear bumper has stylized creases on the plastic cladding, along with 4 parking sensors and a tow hook. The skid plate area below is silver:  \\r\\nThe lower tail lamp clusters are surrounded by red reflectors. In addition to the turn-signal lamp for each side, the left cluster gets a reverse lamp, while the right cluster gets a rear fog lamp. Note that the boot lid does not shut perfectly around the tail lights:  \\r\\nA look at the indicator in action:  \\r\\nThe thick battery pack can be seen clearly under the car. As mentioned before, this is a significant hindrance to ground clearance:  \\r\\nFrom the front, the Kona looks more aggressive than the i20. It has a lot more presence as well:  \\r\\nA regular fuel-powered Kona could compete in the segment just above the i20. The electric powertrain is the reason it\\x92s priced several segments higher:  \\r\\nCompared to the i20, the Kona is 195 mm longer with a 30 mm longer wheelbase. The black cladding helps in giving it more of an SUV / crossover look:  \\r\\nNext to the Venue: ', 'Interior - Front  \\r\\nThe front doors open with a 3-stage action. They feel robust, and at times require a bit too much effort to pull further open. There is no satisfying \"thud\" when you shut them either. It does not feel as well-built as some of the European cars. With the ingress being like you\\'re climbing \\x91into\\x92, rather than \\x91onto\\x92, the Kona feels more like you are entering a hatchback than an SUV. Once inside, you\\'ll find that there\\'s sufficient legroom & headroom at the front. \\r\\nThe functional and understated black & silver dashboard doesn\\x92t flaunt anything futuristic. It does a good job of transitioning consumers over to an EV without making them feel like they are out of their comfort zone. Everything feels very familiar and understandable. Apart from the distinct lack of a gear lever, and a few different metrics on the MID, there isn\\x92t anything else forcing you to acknowledge that this is an electric car. \\r\\nThe Kona comes with a double-decker centre console, offering additional storage space below. The cabin is finished in both soft-touch material and hard plastics. While the center part of the dashboard has soft-touch material, hard plastics are present above and below it. Not something that you\\x92d expect on a 25-lakh car, but like we said earlier, we have to account for the \\x91EV premium\\x92 when it comes to the Kona\\x92s pricing. \\r\\nThe Kona\\x92s air conditioner is just as powerful as any fossil fuel vehicle, and cools the cabin quickly. However, it isn\\x92t as bone-chilling as some of the other Hyundais (eg. Xcent). The blower has a very wide range of 8 speeds. The lowest level is quite peaceful and the top level is powerful but can still be equated to the max blower (typically level 4) on any other vehicle. The blower starts getting loud at level 4 and then gets really loud as you go up to 8. In a selectable \\x91driver only\\x92 mode, the air only flows out from the two rightmost vents. This saves battery power, and the setting is remembered even after you turn the car off and on, so that\\x92s convenient if you are usually driving on your own. \\r\\nLateral view of the dashboard:  \\r\\nLeather-wrapped 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel is the typical smart-looking Hyundai design. It has perfect indents for your thumbs and feels great to hold:  \\r\\nThe steering has controls for the volume, audio and telephone on the left, while cruise control and MID navigation buttons are on the right:  \\r\\nDespite having a single-speed transmission, the Kona comes with paddle shifters. The paddles come with the unique function of controlling the aggressiveness of the regenerative braking. The paddle on the left increases the intensity of regenerative braking (think of it like down-shifting), while the paddle on the right decreases the regen intensity. What\\x92s more, you can bring the car to a complete halt without pressing the brake pedal by simply pulling and holding the left paddle:  \\r\\nSteering has rake & reach adjustment. It has a huge range of travel which greatly helps in finding a good driving position:  \\r\\nThe engine start/stop button comes with blue back-lighting and a silver surround. It also gets a coloured indicator light to show which mode the ignition is in:  \\r\\nThe 7.0-inch digital instrument cluster comes with a power / charge indicator on the extreme left \\x96 which indicates the rate of power drawn or regenerative charging. The extreme right displays the battery charge level (a more exact percentage readout is available on the AVN screen). The instrument cluster also gets a MID, and the speedo display changes depending on the driving mode you select:  \\r\\nHere\\'s a look at the instrument cluster on startup:  \\r\\nThe MID gives various information including tyre pressure and power consumption. The MID also shows the odometer reading and the outside temperature. In Eco mode, it turns green and displays an ECO symbol and the remaining range:  \\r\\nThe various settings that can be changed in the MID:  \\r\\nThe MID display shows which door is open. When the bonnet, sunroof or the boot are open, they flash red. A separate verbose warning is present for when the charging flap is left open:  \\r\\nThe stalks feel solid and are great to use. The vertical silver trimline looks nice. However, the stalks have prominent flash-lines that can be felt where the two plastic pieces are joined. Wipers have five intermittent settings that snap into place with a satisfying little click. Sadly, no auto wipers. You do get auto headlamps though. Fog light is a toggle switch integrated on the RHS stalk. You just push it down, it bounces back up:  \\r\\nCircular air vents on the sides get a silver surround. All AC vents can be shut off completely by angling them all the way to the right:  \\r\\nSwitches for traction control, VESS, auto charging-cable unlock, and interior illumination adjustment. Many blank spaces stick out like a sore thumb in a car at this price point:  \\r\\nOBD port is located at the base of the fuse box. Hyundai\\x92s usual \\x91master On / Off\\' switch for the electricals has been provided too:  \\r\\nLong and slim bonnet release lever is sturdily built and easy to grab:  \\r\\nLike the dashboard, the door-pads get a black colour theme with splashes of silver. They are finished in hard plastics at the top & bottom, and soft-touch material is used in the middle:  \\r\\nDoor handles are finished in silver and they get a silver surround too:  \\r\\nThe driver\\'s and front passenger\\'s windows get one-touch up / down and anti-pinch functionality. Door mirrors are electrically foldable, with an auto setting too:  \\r\\nThe door pads can hold a 1-liter bottle, as well as other small items:  \\r\\nFront seats are draped in black leather upholstery and the seats are comfortable. The floor pan is high but it doesn\\x92t make it difficult to find the right seating position. The only thing that might be a concern is if you are a taller driver, as soon as you start moving the seat up, you are going to run out of headroom. As a 5\\x929\\x94 driver, Rehaan had 2-3 inches of headroom to spare. Side bolstering, as well as under-thigh support is good. Both the front seats are ventilated (and heated) which is a HUGE boon in our tropical conditions:  \\r\\nThe driver\\'s seat is 10-way power-adjustable. The lumbar support is fixed at the perfect height, and has a huge range for its in & out movement:  \\r\\nA look at the perforated leather upholstery. Perforated material is mandatory for the seat\\'s cooling and heating functions:  \\r\\nWhile the driver\\'s seat is power-adjustable, the front passenger seat has manual adjustment:  \\r\\nFront seatbelts are height-adjustable:  \\r\\nSporty looking pedals are well spaced out. Dead pedal provided as well:  \\r\\nORVMs are really tall & wide, providing a good view of things behind you:  \\r\\nElectrochromic IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Thick C-pillars restrict visibility though:  \\r\\nCenter fascia features a touchscreen that sticks out at the top:  \\r\\nA closer look at the split center console design:  \\r\\n7.0\" floating touchscreen head-unit has been covered in a separate post later in the review:  \\r\\nRectangular air vents get round corners and a silver border. The button for the hazard lights is placed in the center:  \\r\\nClimate control module gets a piano black insert and two circular knobs on either side for temperature and fan speed controls. The buttons related to cooling get a blue indicator light, while the ones for heating get an orange light. The beauty of an electric car is that you can run the AC whilst stuck in traffic without feeling guilty about unnecessarily spinning a huge fuel guzzling engine. Another great feature is the \\x93Driver only\\x94 option that minimizes the AC\\x92s battery drain if you\\x92re the only person in the car:  \\r\\nThe center console gets an indicator for the Qi wireless smartphone charging (the charging pad is on the right). A USB port and an AUX-in port are provided next to it:  \\r\\nThe ports are backlit in blue. Convenient:  \\r\\nTwo cupholders of different sizes are located in the center console. The one towards the rear is deeper:  \\r\\nThere\\'s no gear knob in the Kona. Instead, it gets buttons for Drive, Reverse, Park and Neutral. Only the Park button gets a texture on it, making it easier to find than the other buttons. However, it\\x92s still not something you can use easily without looking. We felt that having such a large button for neutral is unnecessary. It is rarely ever used, and Hyundai could have simplified things by making it much smaller, or even hiding it away:  \\r\\nThe letters are backlit in blue, while the currently selected mode displays an orange indicator light:  \\r\\nThe electronic parking brake switch has been placed behind the transmission buttons. The space between the transmission buttons and the parking brake is raised with a piano black insert at the front. The activation and deactivation of the handbrake can be heard inside the cabin as an electric whirring sound:  \\r\\nThe center console also houses buttons for auto hold, drive mode selector and the cooled and heated seats. Cooled front seats are one of the best features to have in India. Props to Hyundai for equipping so many of their cars with it:  \\r\\nThere\\'s a small storage compartment in front of the center armrest:  \\r\\nStorage under the center armrest. The bottom has a foam lining:  \\r\\nThe lower part of the dual-level center console houses a storage area, as well as a 12V socket and a USB port:  \\r\\nThe USB port is backlit in blue:  \\r\\nMedium-sized glovebox is neither cooled nor illuminated:  \\r\\nRoof bezel consists of a compartment for your sunglasses, map lights, and sunroof controls. You can also choose the setting for the activation of the interior lights from here:  \\r\\nFelt-lined holder for your sunglasses:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets 6 airbags including dual front airbags...  \\r\\n\\x85side airbags (please don\\'t use seat covers)\\x85   \\r\\n\\x85and curtain airbags:  \\r\\nThe sunroof is wide, but not very deep. The lower cover has to be moved manually: ', 'Interior - Rear\\r\\nThe rear doors of the Hyundai Kona open and close in a two stage action. The floor pan is very high and ingress is kind of awkward because you are stepping onto a pretty high floor whilst at the same time, trying to lower yourself down onto the seat:  \\r\\nLike the front door-pads, the rear door-pads get a black color scheme. They are finished in hard plastics at the top and the bottom, and soft-touch material is present in the middle. The rear windows do not get one-touch up / down feature:  \\r\\nDoorpad can hold a 1-liter bottle, and other small items:  \\r\\nThe rear seats are best suited for 2, not 3 passengers. Even though the rear window sills are high, the cabin is airy. The sunroof is too far forward and doesn\\'t provide any benefit for the rear passengers at all. Three headrests are provided:  \\r\\nThe rear seat upholstery gets the same perforated material, despite not having any ventilated functionality:  \\r\\nISOFIX child seat anchors have been provided on both sides:  \\r\\nWhile the rear seat certainly doesn\\x92t have the kind of legroom or headroom you\\x92d expect from an \\x91SUV\\x92, we wouldn\\x92t consider either of these deal breakers. You could also say \\x93it has more legroom than a 5-series\\x94 and \\x93more headroom than a CLA-Class\\x94. However, there certainly is one large fly in the ointment -  the noticeably high floor board (due to the battery below). It results in a knees-up sitting position resulting in a lack of under-thigh support, even for shorter passengers. It would be acceptable only for small kids. Take note that this seating position can become uncomfortable very quickly for people suffering from lower back problems. Headroom is liberal. Rehaan @ 5\\'9\", had a good 2\" of clearance, though the i20 headroom is half an inch more than the Kona. The i20 also feels roomier than the Kona, as the Kona has a dip in the roofline to accommodate the sunroof internally, and the raised double-decker centre console visually eats into the cabin space too:  \\r\\nAlthough the legroom in the Kona is good, the i20 has about 2 inches more legroom. Even though the Kona has a longer wheelbase, the rear feels slightly less roomy than in the i20:  \\r\\nYou can see how high the floor is here:  \\r\\nSliding your feet under the front seat is not something most people do, but given that there is no under thigh support, you tend to want to stretch your legs forward. And that\\x92s when you will notice that there\\x92s no space under the front seats (unless the driver\\x92s seat is towards the absolute top of its height range). With the seat in the absolute lowest position, you can\\x92t squeeze more than your toes under there. The high floor due to the battery pack below is the cause of this once again:  \\r\\nAdjustable headrests at the rear are on the harder side:  \\r\\nRear centre armrest has two cupholders:  \\r\\nThe seatbacks are not scooped out. Instead, they have a molded hard plastic cladding. The lower third is covered in an elastic net for storing loose items:  \\r\\nRear cabin lamp follows the lead of whatever the setting is for the front cabin lamp (on, door or off). It can also be turned on individually by pressing its own button:  \\r\\nThe floor hump is not tall, making it easier for the middle passenger. However, the center console reduces the legroom available:  \\r\\nQuarter glass behind the rear window is tiny, and plays a greater role in the aesthetics of the car, rather than affecting the ambiance in the cabin:  \\r\\nPull these levers in order to fold the seatback forward:  \\r\\nThe rear parcel tray is large and is recessed deeply enough to keep items in place:  \\r\\nBoot is just 332L in size. A useful net is provided:  \\r\\nThe Kona gets 60:40 split rear seats:  \\r\\nWith both seats folded down, the boot capacity increases substantially:  \\r\\nAnchor points for child seats:  \\r\\nStorage space on the right to store small items. The other side gets a boot lamp:  \\r\\nSpare tire is a 17\" 135/80 space saver with a speed limit of 80 km/h. The jack is mounted below: ', \"In-Car Entertainment\\r\\nThe Kona EV gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. Connectivity is through Bluetooth, USB and AUX. Apple CarPlay & Android Auto are also supported, with an integrated button on the steering wheel for their voice recognition functions. The presence of these two modern solutions also means that there's a lack of in-built navigation. The touchscreen serves as a display for the reversing camera as well. Due to the smaller size of the screen (mid-variant offered in India), you\\x92re left with a large plastic bezel around it, which certainly doesn't look premium. On the plus side, the touchscreen is really responsive and you get physical buttons for the most used functions. There is also a star button on the right side, which is a custom button that can be set to a particular function of your choice; like the EV info screen, Bluetooth audio, or to even turn the display on / off. \\r\\nThe stereo sound quality is the kind of stuff you see in 12-13 lakh cars. This is not a 25 lakh car audio system at all. Audio sound quality is good. But that\\x92s it. It's not special like you would expect for 25 big ones. At this price point, you want premium sound, which the Kona doesn\\x92t have. The system is rather front biased. The speakers at the front are definitely way better, with deeper richer bass. The speakers at the rear seem cheaper, feeble and less powerful in comparison. At lower volumes, the system is a bit underwhelming and the sound profile seems incomplete. It lacks punch and wholeness. Once you reach about halfway up the volume level (which is significantly loud), it starts to get fuller and more well-rounded. \\r\\nThe touchscreen is placed on top of the center console. A larger screen would have looked more premium:  \\r\\nMusic is played via 6 speakers, including one on each of the 4 doors...  \\r\\n...and a tweeter on both the front doors:  \\r\\nThe main menu gives you access to the screens for phone, media, EV amongst others:  \\r\\nSecond page of the main menu:  \\r\\nA variety of settings can be altered to suit the user's preferences:  \\r\\nAdditionally, the display can be switched off from this screen (for night driving).

We\\'ve shared some tips on maximizing battery life in the \\'Charging\\' section below.  Range \\nAs electric vehicles become more and more popular, manufacturers are soon going to be advertising their prowess in \"km\" figures, rather than \"km/l\". \\nThe ARAI-approved range for the 39.2 kWh Kona is 452 km. Being the official figure, this is the range that is being touted in all marketing material, as well as most reviews. However, let’s be clear that this is very far from the realistic range you can expect the Kona to return. For the ARAI test, the car is run at a constant speed of 40-45 km/h on a flat road and there is no wind resistance. Unrealistic. \\nIn real-world conditions, international reviews as well as a few Indian owners have reported figures ranging between 250-350 km.  \\nIn our road-test, we managed to get:• 288 km on a city + highway trip (223 km traveled + 54 km range remaining + 10 km calculated adjustment for starting at 98%).  \\n• 258 km in Mumbai city traffic + 3 hrs of AC when parked (164 km traveled + 94 km range remaining) \\nMind you, in neither of these cases were we trying to prolong the range in any way. In fact, we were pushing the car a lot harder than most people would in normal driving.Consistently getting above 250 km of range is excellent for an EV in today\\'s times.  \\nSimply put, if you’re using the Kona as a purely city car, range should not be a concern whatsoever. However, if you regularly approach 250 km/day, managing range will require some planning.  Charging \\nThe Kona can be charged with 3 different chargers:1) Fastest: DC Quick Charger (50 kW): This is a CCS Type 2 charger that can charge the car from 0-80% in a blazing fast 57 minutes. It’s big, and it’s expensive – so isn’t ideal for personal ownership. Hyundai has tied up with IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) to set up these fast charging stations in 1 fuel pump in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai each. Hopefully, a good market response to the Kona will have more of these charging stations sprouting up soon. \\n2) Normal: AC Wall Station Charger (7.2 kW): This wall-mounted charger comes free with your Kona, and would typically be set up at your parking space. It takes 6 hrs 10 mins to fully charge the car. If you charge for just 1 hour, you’ll get roughly 50 km of range. Hyundai has tied up with Allianz Worldwide to provide consultancy on the installation of the charger. They will assess the residence type, power connection and upgradation if required for the installation. Customer reports say there might be an installation charge of Rs. 3,000, not including the required wiring to the point of installation, which will be at your expense. If you wish to purchase an additional 7.2 kW charger, expect to pay roughly Rs. 80,000 for it. Hyundai dealerships that sell the Kona will also be equipped with this charger for Kona owners to stop by and use. We did not get to use this type of charger, but Kona owner & BHPian sheldon.dz says that it takes about 30-60 seconds to power on, and requires a card to be swiped to start & stop charging. Sounds inconvenient! Hope there is a way to circumvent that. \\n3) Slow: Portable Charger (2.8 kW): A portable charger is provided free with every Kona. It resides in a bag in the boot of the car. Having this with you at all times certainly provides a great safety net and adds to the peace of mind. The slow charger can be connected to any 15 Amp socket (the larger 3-pin sockets used for ACs and fridges). This one is rather slow, and takes 19 hours to fully charge the car. If you just want a 50 km bump up in range, it can get that done in less than 3 hours. This is the charger we used. No card is required, and it starts charging immediately.Additionally, in case you run out of charge on the road, Hyundai has a fleet of Konas equipped with a car-to-car power converter for charging. They are currently in four cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. Hyundai has also tied up with MapMyIndia to display EV charging stations in their app, as well as on the Hyundai website. \\nIf you want to prolong the life of your battery, you need to understand that batteries hate HEAT. Charging results in high battery temperatures. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat gets generated. Hence, we\\'d suggest you avoid fast charging when not necessary, and even reduce the charging rate for daily charging via your vehicle\\'s settings menu. In addition to that, you can set the Kona to stop charging at 80-90%, which also aids battery health. Doing these things will not only extend the lifetime of your battery, but will also minimize range-degradation as your battery ages. \\nThe lithium-ion polymer battery is placed at floor level:  \\nA look at the battery pack.

The Kona comes with the CCS Type 2 charger. The charger combines AC charging as well as DC charging. The two lower contact pins are for DC fast charging. Most manufacturers including Jaguar, Volkswagen, BMW and Ford use CCS chargers, whereas cars like the Nissan Leaf use CHAdeMO charger. All public charging stations in India are expected to support both CCS, as well as CHAdeMO:  \\nThe charger screen displays various information. SOC stands for State Of Charge:  \\nThe light around the charging port gives the status of the charging. White indicates that the charging door is open and charging is on standby, green shows that the car is charging, blinking green indicates that scheduled charging is set, blinking red indicates a charging error, while a yellow light indicates that the 12V battery is charging or that the scheduled climate control is operating:  \\nThe battery indicator shows the battery level. The button to the right of it lights up when a scheduled charge is active. Pressing the button for 3 seconds cancels the scheduled charge in case of any emergencies:  \\nOn the infotainment display inside the car, the energy information screen shows the time required to charge from your current battery level up till 100% for each type of charger. Useful!:  \\nYou can set the limit to which you want the battery to charge. This is useful when you are charging from a station where you need to pay per unit of electricity used, or if you’d like to stop the charging before the charge rate slows down for the final few percent. This limit can be set separately for AC & DC charging:  \\nYou can also schedule off-peak charging to control the exact times between which the battery charges. This is useful when electricity pricing is different depending on the time of day.

That equates to 134 BHP of power, and torque is rated at 395 Nm. The advertised 0-100 km/h time is 9.7 seconds. To put that into perspective, it matches the Polo GT TSI. It\\x92s snappy! \\r\\nWhen Hyundai informed us that the electric car drive was at the Buddh formula 1 circuit, I thought it was a pretty bad idea. But as soon as we were out of the pits and turned the first two corners I changed my mind! This thing is fun. Hitting the second corner, powering through it, a bit of wheelspin and a touch of opposite lock; it is a surprisingly fun and well-composed car! Interestingly, the Kona felt very much at home on the track. Unlike an internal combustion car, where the engine would be screaming and running out of breath towards the end of each gear, the Kona did it without any theatricals. Just the squealing tyres. We even gave it a bit of a high-speed run down the straight and it pulled northwards of 150 km/h without making us wait too long.  \\r\\nAs much fun as it might be on track, it\\x92s on the streets that the beauty of max torque from 0 RPM really shines. What I absolutely love about an electric car in city traffic is that there is just nothing that can beat it off the line so effortlessly. Quietly, no revving up, no slipping clutch, no going high up the revs. Just a faint electric purr and you are out ahead of everyone else at the signal. If there is anyone keeping up, they are probably giving it the beans and the whole world can tell. At most, the Kona lets out an electric whirr that\\x92s noticeable if you listen closely enough. You could even say that the electric whine is kind of space age and cool. \\r\\nClosing gaps in traffic and doing quick overtakes is also seamless, thanks to the punchy nature at city speeds. In a conventional-engined car, you have to think about which gear you are in, what speed you are at and whether you need to downshift. In an electric car, the ever-present & linear torque delivery makes it so seamless. The lack of gear changes also enables a smoother experience for passengers.  Driving Modes \\r\\nThe Kona has 4 selectable driving modes. Each mode has a differently mapped throttle response, brake regen level defaults, instrument cluster display layouts, and a few ancillary changes to optimize battery utilization. \\r\\nYou can cycle through these modes by pressing the \\x91Drive Mode\\x92 button located ahead of the front edge of the driver\\x92s armrest. I didn\\x92t like where this drive mode button was placed because you have to take your eyes off the road to locate it, and then crane your elbow back to manage to reach it with your fingers. \\r\\nThe 4 drive modes available are: \\x95 Sport Mode: Needless to say, the throttle is the sharpest and most eager in this mode. The car feels peppy, with even a 25% dab of the throttle having the nose rise up as the car surges forward. That said, it\\x92s still easily usable in everyday driving. The main dial on the instrument cluster has the needle pointing to the \\x91power %\\x92 being utilized with a digital speed reading in the middle. I\\x92m not so much of a fan of this \\x96 simply because I know how far down my foot is on the throttle, and I\\x92d rather see the needle showing the speed. In Sport mode, the brake pedal also gets an extremely wooden feel to it for the first inch or two of travel, after which it regains some feel and gets a bit easier to modulate. \\r\\n\\x95 Comfort Mode: The Kona will always start in Comfort mode, unless you previously shut it down on an even more efficient mode (Eco / Eco+). The throttle still feels lively, but not over-eager. The digital instrument cluster simulates a more traditional speedo layout, with the remaining range in km conveniently displayed in the center.  \\r\\n\\x95 Eco Mode: In this mode, the throttle is less than eager, and you have the option to set a max speed limit too (90, 100, 110, 120 or 130 km/h). The logic is that the faster you are going, the more aerodynamic resistance there will be, causing you to waste precious battery power fighting it. The slower you go (less wind resistance), the more efficient your driving can be. If set, kicking down lets you break this limit for the times you need to overtake. Interestingly, in Eco mode, the instrument cluster shows you how many km of range you have gained every time you brake, thanks to the regenerative braking (more on this later). The climate control is also restrained to a more conservative profile in Eco mode. \\r\\n\\x95 Eco+ Mode: This is just like Eco mode. However, it\\x92s more extreme. Pressing the mode button cycles through only the above 3 modes and skips this Eco+ mode. To get to it, you have to long-press the mode button. For Eco+ the speed limit is fixed at a maximum of 90 km/h, and the climate control system is disabled. You\\x92d only want to use this mode if you were desperately trying to extend your battery for as many km as you could.PRND Selection \\r\\nThe Kona has a single-speed reduction transmission. You do however have to switch between Park, Neutral, Reverse and Drive using a set of 4 buttons. This isn\\x92t too difficult to get used to. However, the issue is locating and using the buttons quickly without having to look at them for reference every time. The Park button does have a textured strip at the top of it, but even then, it\\x92s still hard to confidently locate the others in a purely tactile way. We grumbled about this quite a bit, but then discovered a way to make it work. There is a raised mound behind this set of 4 buttons. If you cup that with your left palm, the buttons fall consistently at your fingertips, making them much easier to use without having to look at them. \\r\\nQuick-shifters take note that your foot has to be on the brake pedal when switching between PRND. This can sometimes catch you off-guard when doing a really quick 3-point turn, and the transmission hasn\\x92t actually shifted between Reverse and Drive despite you pressing the button. It doesn\\x92t matter if the Kona is at 0 km/h \\x96 you have to have your foot on the brake to make a successful shift.  Parking Brake \\r\\nThe Parking Brake (P) is an electronic pull / push switch located a few inches behind the PRND selector buttons. It engages and disengages the rear brakes with a soft electric whirring sound. It\\x92s important to know that the Parking Brake is more of a \\x91prevent the car from rolling or auto-creeping forward\\x92 than a safeguard against accidental acceleration. As soon as you press the accelerator, the Parking Brake will disengage! This is unlike the conventional handbrake behaviour, and can be a little dangerous \\x96 especially in a car that makes no engine noise to warn the person in the driver\\x92s seat that it is running. The Parking Brake will also disengage as soon as you switch between modes on the transmission selector (eg. go from Reverse to Drive). \\r\\nConversely, there are times when the Parking Brake automatically engages. For example, if you open the door whilst the car is in Drive \\x96 the brake will engage. This is a good safety feature to prevent the car from rolling. \\r\\nDo note that since the Parking Brake is electrically actuated, it takes about 1.5 seconds to fully engage. As a result, if you leave the brake pedal as soon as you pull the Parking Brake button, the car will surge forward slightly before the brakes fully bite. In other words, you need to keep your foot on the brake pedal for at least a second or two after pulling the Parking Brake. \\r\\nWhen the transmission is in \\x93Park\\x94 but the Parking Brake isn\\x92t engaged, the car can roll up to an inch or two forwards and backwards (eg. if someone leans on it). Remember to always park safe & use the Parking Brake.  Auto-Hold  \\r\\nBy default, the Kona starts to move forward as soon as you take your foot off the brake pedal. This is the safer default mode for a dead-silent EV, since it doesn\\x92t give the person in the driver\\x92s seat the opportunity to presume the vehicle is \\x91parked\\x92 and do some damage by accidentally hitting the accelerator. Conversely, the fact that it moves forward once you release the brake could catch people unaware too - but the behaviour is more like a conventional automatic that people are used to. \\r\\nThe alternative is turning on \\x91Auto Hold\\x92. With this activated, the Kona will hold itself in place every time it comes to a complete stop. Touching the accelerator will release the Auto Hold. This mode is much more convenient in stop & go traffic, as you do not need to keep your foot on the brake, and aren\\x92t really required to keep playing with the Parking Brake or transmission selector. \\r\\nFor the sake of safety, Auto Hold always resets to \\x91off\\x92 every time the car starts up.  Brakes \\r\\nSimilar to fossil-fuel vehicles, Electric Vehicles can brake in two ways; using the brake discs & via engine braking. However, the difference here is that when an EV brakes with engine braking, the motor is actually working as a generator and recharging the battery using the vehicle\\x92s momentum. \\r\\nAs a result, all modern EVs have regenerative braking built-in. However, brake regen adds a degree of complication to the braking procedure. The braking system has to intelligently figure out when it should be using the \\x91engine braking\\x92 and when it should be using the brake discs \\x96 most EVs do a damn good job of this. They also have to mix and smoothly transition between the two types of braking, which have their own unique deceleration characteristics and feel; and quite frankly no EV does a perfect job of it. This results in two things - brake pedal feel being artificial and braking results being non-linear. \\r\\nThe Kona is no exception. The non-linear braking behaviour makes it a little hard to modulate smoothly, especially for the first 10% of brake pedal travel \\x96 where only the regen braking is kicking in before the calipers actually grab the discs. In addition to that, in Sport mode the brake pedal becomes extremely wooden. We\\x92re not sure why this happens, but it wasn\\x92t an issue in Eco or Comfort modes. \\r\\nMind you, regardless of brake pedal feel, braking performance is excellent. The car is smart enough to always apply \\x91engine braking\\x92 when required, so that greatly aids the stopping power. Even on the racetrack, we didn\\x92t ever have the ABS intruding on hard braking.  Regenerative Braking \\r\\nAnother great trick the Kona has up its sleeve is the ability to fine-tune how much brake regen gets applied. The amount of battery recharge coming from these modes finally totals up to roughly the same thing, but what\\x92s different is the level of aggressiveness or immediacy of the regenerative brake force applied. You\\x92ll feel the regen kick in as soon as you begin to release the accelerator pedal. \\r\\nYou can adjust the level of regen by using the \\x91paddle shifters\\x92 behind the steering wheel. Pressing the left paddle increases the aggressiveness of the regen (think of it like downshifting), whilst pressing the right paddle eases up on the regen. \\r\\nThere are 5 different levels of regenerative braking that you can choose between: \\x95 Level 0: This effectively turns off the brake regen. When you lift your foot off the accelerator, there is absolutely no brake regen or engine braking applied. The Kona will continue to coast forward as if it were in neutral. Needless to say, no recharge happens when you lift off the accelerator pedal on Level 0. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 1: There\\x92s a reason this is the default regen level for Comfort & Sport modes. It is the closest in feel and behaviour to driving a normal car. I\\x92d advise Kona owners to get familiar with this level first, before exploring the more aggressive levels of regen. Lift off the accelerator here, and the car slowly starts to decelerate without a sudden jerk or alarming change in velocity. This is the most relatable level for first time EV drivers and will be comfortable for passengers too. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 2: If level 1 is like lifting off the gas pedal when at 80 km/h in 4th gear, level 2 is like doing the same thing when in 3rd gear instead. It\\x92s just a little more aggressive in deceleration. As expected, you\\x92d get more regenerative benefits from this before hitting the actual brakes, and that\\x92s why it\\x92s the default for Eco mode. When you\\x92re in a driving situation where you can plan your stopping (eg. traffic light or toll booth visible in the distance), you can easily rely on level 2 regen braking to do most of the work of bringing the car to a full halt. This would also be a great mode to use on steep mountain descents. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 3: Ever suddenly lift off the accelerator in 1st or 2nd gear? That\\x92s what level 3 regen feels like. In fact, when you first start using this mode and are still getting the hang of releasing the accelerator smoothly, you need to be careful that there are no vehicles right behind you. Thankfully, all regen braking also activate the Kona\\x92s brake lights! So why would you use this level of super-aggressive regen braking? Well, as you start to get used to it, you\\x92ll find yourself releasing the accelerator incredibly slowly, and in doing so, modulating the braking as well. Just imagine the accelerator is stuck to your foot, and you\\x92re pulling it back very slowly, rather than just lifting your foot off it. This can enable you to drive the car without the need to use the brake pedal, be it in city traffic or on the highway. Hyundai calls this \\x91one-pedal driving\\x92, and with a little practice, it certainly is possible \\x96 and the regen is hugely beneficial for the battery range. Sudden (unplanned) braking will still require you to use the good ol\\x92 brake pedal though. \\r\\n\\x95 Level 4: Well, there isn\\x92t really a \\x91level 4\\x92, but if you keep the left paddle pulled towards you it applies the maximum brake regen available. It is quite literally a \\x93hand-brake\\x94. You can use this trick regardless of what level (0-3) you\\x92re currently in, but for the time you have the paddle pulled, it will display \\x91level 3\\x92 on the instrument cluster. This can be used for bringing the car to a full halt quite easily. In fact, we used it often on the Buddh circuit to drop speed before turning into corners. What you need to be aware of here is that it\\x92s a very square braking profile; it\\x92s very sudden with no gradual increase in deceleration, and there\\x92s no way for you to modulate it using the paddle (which can be a bit unnerving if you\\x92re using it in traffic). Even though this is very sudden deceleration, it\\x92s still nowhere near the kind of stopping power you get with brakes \\x96 so this will not be replacing the brake pedal for emergency or quick braking situations. As soon as you release the paddle, the regen returns to the previous setting you were on, and if the car is at a standstill, it will remain there without moving forward, until you touch the accelerator or brake. EDIT: The brochure claims the stopping distance can be modulated by using the accelerator pedal whilst pulling the left paddle. Unfortunately, we did not get to try this whilst driving.Steering \\r\\nWhether driving on the track, on the highway or in the city, we had absolutely no complaints about the Kona\\x92s steering. This is usually a weak point for Hyundais, but they\\x92ve done a good job here. Let\\x92s be clear that it\\x92s far from an involving enthusiast steering, and it lacked feedback. But it\\x92s direct, weighs up nicely (a touch on the heavy side, even at city speeds) and it\\x92s got good on-centre feel. The average driver won\\x92t have any complaints at all.  Handling  \\r\\nHandling too is impressive for a car that is a crossover / SUV. Body roll is certainly present, but it is very well managed. The suspension is clearly sprung a little stiff, and having the weight of the battery at floorboard level helps keep the center of gravity low. Watching people clipping their test drive Konas through the chicane at BIC at 80-90 km/h, we could see the car roll a bit, but then hold itself there quite maturely. \\r\\nThe weakest link in the handling equation is the Nexen N\\'Fera SU1s. Despite being marketed as high-performance summer tyres, they left us wanting more. Even when driving through the Lonavala ghats, GTO said that he could feel the tyres losing grip way before the car wanted to, accompanied by the smell of burning rubber.  Ride Quality \\r\\nI\\x92ll be frank. The worst thing about the Kona is the ride quality. By a long shot. \\r\\nThe ride is taut and uncompromising. Think EcoSport, but worse. \\r\\nIt\\x92s uncomfortable on imperfect roads. Potholes, especially the big ones, come in bone-jarringly sharp. What\\x92s more, Rehaan says that even mild undulations on well-paved tarmac roads (eg. lightly wavering Marine Drive) had him being shaken up and down. If you were travelling along this same road in any other car, you wouldn\\x92t have even noticed this unless you were really paying attention. Even minor undulations on flyovers and on the expressway can be felt in the car. This is not a plush ride at all. \\r\\nInterestingly, we would have never figured this out during the media drive on the track. We got a tiny hint of it as we crossed an expansion joint in the garage lane, but this is something that only the real-world experience of driving on the road let us figure out. \\r\\nThe Kona has a surprisingly high recommended tyre pressure of 36 PSI. Could this be because of the weight of the car? Is it a way to improve battery range? We\\x92re not sure. But we did reduce the pressure to 32 PSI to see if it improved the ride \\x96 and the answer is; not much. Perhaps the stiff sidewalls of the Nexens are a contributing factor too. \\r\\nCombine the poor ride quality with the un-ergonomic seating position of the rear bench, and you\\'ll quickly realise that the Kona is far from ideal for rear seat passengers.  Ground Clearance \\r\\nThe Kona certainly doesn\\x92t have the ground clearance of an SUV, or even a crossovers. Hyundai did not share any official ground clearance figure with the press, despite many requests for it. There\\'s no doubt that it\\'s an unimpressive figure, especially for an \"SUV\". On extremely broken rural roads the Kona scraped where regular sedans would scrape (eg. Honda City). Even dressed-up hatchback crossovers would not scrape in these places. We faced no issues on urban speed breakers though. We measured the ground clearance of the Kona to be ~171 mm, however, this is a constant low-point (battery housing) across the entire wheelbase of the car, making it much more likely to bottom out.  NVH / VESS \\r\\nDespite the silence of an electric car making other sounds more noticeable, road noise was well controlled, and wind noise is barely present below 100 km/h.  \\r\\nThe silence of electric cars has made certain governments put requirements in place to have EVs make an audible sound when in motion, in order to warn pedestrians, cyclists, etc. I even found myself using the horn more often than I would have if I was driving a regular noisy car. The Kona has a Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS) to create somewhat of an audible warning, but more so to fulfil this legislative requirement. It turns itself on every time you start the car, but can be disabled by pressing the VESS button near the driver\\x92s right knee. Even with the system enabled, we could barely hear the difference (inside and outside the car). There was just a slight electric hiss / whine when the VESS was turned on, and surprisingly it was equally audible inside the cabin as it was outside of it. When VESS is enabled, a beeping sound plays when you put the car in Reverse gear \\x96 did you ever think reversing horns would come back in vogue? \\r\\nThe VESS sound was just about audible at the track, but may not be heard on our noisy streets. The system was manually switched on at the 00:16 mark in the video during a slow drive-by. You can also listen to the sound difference between the Tuscon (lead car) and the Konas down the main straight:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGsggVIMH44          \\r\\nThe engine bay layout is rather conventional. Remember, the Kona is also sold with gas-guzzling engines internationally:  \\r\\nPull off the plastic cladding, and this is what you\\'re left with. There is a LOT of free space in this engine bay:  \\r\\nYou get a regular 12V battery too. It charges off the main battery pack periodically:  \\r\\nIf you look deeper you can see the bell housing of the single-speed transmission:  \\r\\nInterestingly, the underside of the hood gets sound insulation:  \\r\\nThe firewall gets insulation too:  \\r\\nThe MID displays instructions on using the transmission selector, as well as displays which gear you select:  \\r\\nWhen you cup the strange bump with your hand, the PRND buttons fall at your fingertips, making them easier to operate without taking your eyes off the road:  \\r\\nWhen you switch the Drive Mode, the MID indicates what mode you\\'ve chosen:  \\r\\nThe infotainment screen also displays a full-screen notification:  \\r\\nThe Sport mode instrument cluster layout shows a \"Power %\" dial. Note the remaining km in the top right for this mode and the following ones:  \\r\\nComfort mode\\'s display is more traditional. The range displayed dead-center is convenient:  \\r\\nFor Eco mode the dial goes green, indicating the zone you should stay in. Note the increase in range (top right):  \\r\\nEco+ is the same as Eco, with an unchangeable 90 km/h limit. You\\'ll also be sweating it out without any climate control, but note the range bump:  \\r\\nThe additional km of range gained from regenerative braking is displayed in the Eco / Eco+ modes. This add-on counter resets each time you brake. Note the blue icon for the regen level (0-3) displayed below:  \\r\\nThe default regen level can be set for each drive mode. Every time you switch drive modes, the regen will always reset to this pre-defined level:  \\r\\nThe settings for each drive mode can be changed individually:  \\r\\nClimate control and energy regeneration can be adjusted for the \\x91Comfort\\x92 and \\x91Sport\\x92 driving modes:  \\r\\nFor Eco mode, the maximum speed limit can also be set. Eco+ is fixed at 90 km/h:  \\r\\nThe alert notification for a change in Drive mode can be selected too. You can disable the big pop-up on the infotainment screen: ', \"Other Points\\n•    The electric version of the Kona was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show and is sold in Australia, Canada, Europe, Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States. \\n•    In the international market, the Kona is also offered in conventional petrol, diesel and hybrid variants. They get slightly different exterior and interior design. \\n•    The Kona is named after the western district of Hawaii. The car is also called Kauai in Portugal and Encino in China. \\n•    Hyundai showcased the non-electric Kona Iron Man Edition at the 2018 Auto Expo. \\n•    The electric Kona was first seen testing in India in October 2018. \\n•    The electric Kona was showcased at Move: The Global Mobility Summit 2018 held in New Delhi in September 2018. \\n•    The Kona Electric is brought in as ‘Part-by-Part’ (PxP), which we're told is very similar to CKD. It is assembled at Hyundai's plant in Chennai. \\n•    Here's a controversial thought: Just like drivers of certain luxury brands or registration districts sometimes have a bad reputation, I wonder if the opposite will become true for cars with green number plates. Obviously the owners care enough about the planet to put their money where their mouth is, so maybe they will also be more responsible road users, exhibit better road manners and more civic sense? \\n•    When filing air at the pump, even the attendants there keep agreeing that this is the future, ironically “because diesel and petrol are becoming so expensive”. Everyone is impressed with the 280 km range. \\n•    Based on current electricity rates, the running cost of the Kona works out to a paltry 0.8 - 1.1 Rupees / km. GTO did Mumbai – Pawna – Mumbai in just 220 bucks. The cost is so insignificant that it'll be a rounding off error for most households. In fact, he paid more in tolls than he did for the electric charge. \\n•    I love that you can set the soft-touch turn indicator to either be off, 3 flashes, 5 flashes, or 7 flashes. The default 3 flashes in most cars is just too short. \\n•    Hill-hold prevents the Kona from rolling backwards on inclines. Another advantage of EVs - there’s no clutch slipping wear & tear during hill starts. People who have to park on a slope regularly will appreciate this. \\n•    Sometimes despite your foot being on the accelerator, you feel a difference in the Kona's resistance to moving forward when you change the regen braking level. This happens because even when your foot is pressing the accelerator, the car may just be coasting (not actively accelerating), and hence a change in the aggressiveness of the regen can be felt. \\n•    Regenerative braking does not work when in reverse gear. Also, you cannot change the current level of regen whilst your foot is on the brake pedal. \\n•    The official kerb weight has not been shared by Hyundai. Unofficial figures point to a hefty 1,535 kg for the 39.2 kWh version. Undoubtedly, the batteries make up a large part of the weight. \\n•    Service interval is every 10,000 km. Part of the air-conditioning system also helps cool the battery, and the coolant for this is changed at each service. \\n•    Standard warranty coverage is for 3 years / unlimited km. Extensions for the 4th and 5th years / 1,00,000 km can be purchased. We strongly recommend the max possible coverage available.  \\n•    Hyundai is providing roadside assistance to all new Konas for a period of 3 years from the date of sale. \\n•    Warranty coverage for the battery is 8 years / 1,60,000 km. The main concern with older EVs was that the battery would have to be replaced within a few years, increasing the ownership cost significantly. An 8-year warranty will bring peace of mind to the owners. \\n•    Service bays for the Kona get electrically insulated floor mats. Service personnel get insulated gloves and tools. \\n•    In July 2019, the government reduced the GST on electric cars from 12% to 5% and the price of the Kona reduced by Rs. 1.58 lakh. The government will also provide an additional income tax deduction of Rs. 1.5 lakh on interest paid on loans taken for the purchase of electric vehicles. \\n•    BHPian PPS brings to our notice that some states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan & Goa don't levy any road tax while registering EVs. \\n•    Hyundai says they have received 300 bookings so far, and as a result, all allocated units for India in 2019 have been sold out. \\n•    A Hyundai Kona EV in Canada caught fire in a garage recently. The cause hasn’t been conclusively determined as yet. \\n•    When setting up your charging station at home, do also account for the additional cost of wiring required from the meter box to your parking spot. BHPian sheldon.dz says that he paid Rs. 28,000 for the wiring that was installed by his building maintenance team. \\n•    Hyundai is expected to build a dedicated EV platform called E-GMP, which will have flexible battery capacity and a high voltage system to reduce charging time. \\n•    View the Hyundai Kona Electric brochure (Kona_Brochure.pdf), and the owners manual (Kona_Owners_Manual.pdf). \\n•    Disclaimer: Hyundai invited Team-BHP for the Kona Electric test-drive. They covered all the travel expenses for this driving event.\", \"The Smaller yet Significant Things\\nThe Kona Electric is available in Marina Blue...  \\n...Phantom Black...  \\n...Typhoon Silver...  \\n...Polar White...  \\n...and Polar White with a Phantom Black roof.

A mass manufacturer launching a true international EV with all the service support, long warranties and respectable range. This is entirely different from all the gimmicks Tata and Mahindra have been doing. Hyundai to me is the best car manufacurer in India now. Sometimes I think their second position in Indian market is by choice. They have everything that is needed to dethrone Suzuki if they wish. \\nKona can be a great urban commuter. Even though you spend 23 lakhs, the fuel expenses over the 8 year period will be surprisingly lower compared to the ICE cars. 1 Re per km is very cheap. For a monthly running of 1500kms, I pay about 7000 Rs per month for diesel with average FE of 15km per litre. That takes my 8 year fuel expense to 6-7 lakhs, while for a Kona it would only be 1.5 lakhs. At the end of 8 years, I dont think my diesel car would fetch any resale value, becaue the world will be electric by then. So it kind of makes sense to go for this even if it is expensive by 5-6 lakhs, because you will save on fuel costs and the resale value will be almost nil for diesel counter parts in a decade.', \"Great detailed review as usual from Team-BHP.   \\r\\nHyundai is able to develop one of the most efficient EVs using their existing petrol vehicle platforms.

TRIVIA about KONA Name\\nActually its named differently (Kauai) in Portugal because the phonetically identical word \"cona\" in Portuguese is a slang for female genitalia.

I see still a few issues for this:  \\nWouldn't a 7.2 kWh charging point require load sanction and special meter from the distribution company - I know because BEST has several rules regarding high loads being connected.  \\nOur urban system of apartments and parking will not easily allow for charging infrastructure - e.g. Parking spots are supposed to be rotated every year and even if one does have a permanent spot / garage in an urban area (a rare luxury indeed) no other car could be parked there. I am not even getting into the street parking issues. Then probably the fast charger would be best - go have your morning chai/coffee at an IOC pump while your electric is being juiced up!  \\nPresent lack of standardisation - Kona will have one type of charger/socket/voltage specifications, the Tata Tigor EV another and say the Mahindra/Maruti a third. How many charging stations will one install in a multi-car household? If I do invest in a Kona, 5 years down the line battery or charging technology will change and after the battery life is over in 7-8 years, it will simply become a dead duck.  \\n Economic calculations seem to be way off yet and polluting aspects of Li-ion/Polymer and additional thermal power generation required are very debatable. Even for lead acid batteries we have a very poor record (and it is how lead is getting into our food chain). If one counts the interest cost of Rs. 12-15 lakhs EV premium at 7%, it will easily match or be higher than average annual fuel costs net of electricity costs at current levels and you still have that 12 lakhs in your bank/pocket.  \\nSafety aspect of batteries have not yet been fully sorted out in mobiles/electronics - early days of fossil fuels also saw enough incidents - this may yet take some time.   \\n In your other thread many have pointed out other aspects and issues of EVs. That being said, the following will make the move to EVs much more feasible - my opinion only:  \\n1. Start EVs for public transport - local trains and metros are a great example of electric power being used for mobility.

It has been a nice experience so far.  \\nThe folks from Advaith Hyundai in Bangalore were excellent all through and so have the guys guiding the installation of the level 2 charger at home.This part has been contracted to M/s AWP services India Pvt Limited. The charger that is installed is from DELTA. \\nWhile the level one charging is happening without a hitch, I am having troubles getting the level 2 charging going. I live in an independent house and I expect that those living in apartments may have a different take on this. \\nI will dedicate this post only to the charging issues as most else has been alluded to in the original post. \\n1. The company doing the installation of the level 2 charger visited my house once the car was allocated. He, in discussion with our layout electrician, worked out the wiring and additional fitments required.The following was installed: \\na)The power was drawn from just after the meter with large gauge wires running to the designated location of installation of charger. \\nb)upgraded fuses and cutouts- there is a 63A cutout installed just before the charger. Another 15A plug installed with it's own cutout for the level 1 charger. \\nc)Application made to BESCOM to enhance the load from 5KV to 7.5KV for the house. \\n2. Once the car was delivered, with both level 1 and 2 chargers in the boot, the technician from the installation company came back and guided installation of the charger.  \\n3. The level 1 charger is connected to the aforementioned 15A plug and works well. \\n4. However, I am having troubles with the level 2 charger. It is drawing 30A of current (which is the limit that the electricity meter can handle). My electrician advices me that running this for long can damage the meter as well as the cabling from the house to the transformer. So I haven't been able to use this yet. The last time I tried, the fuse to the house blew. Another attempt after fixing this resulted in the 30A draw and we aborted the experiment. \\nSo as it stands, though I have been provided the level 2 charger by Hyundai, I am unable to use it.I have to use the trickle charger (Level 1) that draws about 3.5A current. \\nSo, there are real-world problems here. My options as I can think of are as below: \\n1. Ask to increase the load to 15KV to the house. This is going to be a challenge as all the wiring and the meter will need changing and the electricity bill will shoot through the roof! \\n2. Wait for the 7.5KV load to be sanctioned and try again. Not sure this will work as the meter is maxing out at 30A \\n3. Re-adjust the settings in the charger to allow a maximum of 15-20A current draw. It has this facility. But the guys who did the installation are \\nnot keen to do this and they are not sure of warranty etc will be effected - though I am not sure I understand how! \\n4. Make adjustments in the car to set the maximum current draw to minimum or medium (though what the actual current drawn will be is not mentioned) \\nTo summarise the car seems to need 30A to charge with the level 2 charger (5-6 hours for 0-100% charging). This 30A cannot be obtained without major work rewiring and electrical work AND and upgrade of electricity supply from BESCOM and increased electricity bills. I would like to be proven wrong on this.... \\nSo, that's were we are at present. Please feel free to share your ideas and experiences.

In cases of vehicular fires that were the result of damaged Li-ion batteries, the fire was limited to the area where the batteries were contained before it could be extinguished. \\r\\nIn fact, more than a collision, the major issue with Li-ion battery cells is that they can generate enough heat, sometimes during their normal operation and at other times due to short-circuit or external damage, to cause a reaction known as \\x93thermal runaway.\\x94  \\r\\nHowever, to address the issue, the vehicle\\x92s batteries are typically surrounded by a protective cooling shroud filled with chilled liquid coolant from a traditional-style automotive radiator. Which is why we are seeing a standard coolant bottle in all of the pics of the engine bay of electric test mules. In the event the batteries do overheat despite their external cooling, batteries in all models of electric vehicles are installed in an array rather than as one large battery pack. These battery clusters are further divided by firewalls that limit the amount of damage each is capable of causing if it were to malfunction. \\r\\nBottomline, the batteries are safe. And in future, we'll probably get solid state batteries which don't rely on electrolytes so the risk of a fire is further mitigated.\", \"Thank you for your patient reply, you have me convinced.

This “armour” has an effect on construction, weight, size and overall design of the vehicle.  \\nBut your observation is correct. The crash test in itself isn't specifically tailor made for electric vehicles. Too little research has been done into the behaviour of battery components under crash conditions.  \\nI've driven in countries like Italy where the tarmac is smooth and barely any speed breakers or broken roads. Electric cars being tested there will pass with flying colors.  \\nIn India , the risk of an impact from below is high. A friend's Honda City got hit from below rupturing the engine oil pan and draining all the engine oil risking engine seizure. There's a team bhp thread about the same issue which you can read here (Underbody Hit & Cracked Sump : Implications, Vulnerabilities, Responsibilities).If you see the battery placement on the Kona, it eats into the ground clearance substantially as the battery pack hangs below the floor sails, thereby also at a higher risk for underbody impact. There is some protection though but it's something which will be tested. It remains to be seen what's the battery placement on the MG ZS EV.  \\nI'm sure that the cars have been tested in Indian conditions but I do feel the early adopters will be guinea pigs as far as this aspect is concerned.

The co-founder Maxson Lewis, was kind enough to discuss & talk to me about the various charging points and also his plans. I just wanted to spread the good word around for all you EV Owners, based on my discussion with him:Magenta Power is a Govt of India approved company for setting up charging stations. Magenta Power has a few charging stations in and around Mumbai. They are planning more stations in Pune as well. But their priority is Lonavala, as it would help commuters between the 2 cities. HPCL is an investor in their company. So, I expect to see a few charging stations set up in & around HPCL's. In fact, they are also trying to wrap up the discussion with Hyundai for Kona. They have a charging station along the expressway right after the Lonavala exit bridge ends (while driving from Pune to Mumbai). However, right now, it only supports the various Mahindra EV's like Tigor & Verito. Not yet for the likes of Kona & ZS. For us, we'll have to use the 16 AMP socket to charge up. This is about to change in about 10 odd days from today. They should have a 50 KW CCS TYPE 2 charger ready.  This should certainly help us. After Lonavala, the plan is to expand here in Pune, then going down further South along the Bangalore route. I did ask him to do something for the Goa route.  He also has plans for down south as well. \\r\\nAll in all, things are shaping up pretty well and is starting to look good. I hope his tie-up with Hyundai works out well, as it would mean, we don't have to be overly stingy / have range anxiety - about our rides to/from Mumbai / Pune.  \\r\\nLong run, it would also mean we would have a better support network on highways, away from cities. \\r\\nI wish the very best to Maxson & his team and hope he's able to set up a good support network along major routes....at least between Mumbai & Pune to begin with. I hope this piece of information is useful for everyone here. \\r\\nNow, I'm eagerly looking forward to my Kona and to my drive to Mumbai on Kona and juicing it up on the 50KW fast charger at Lonavala. \\r\\nEDIT: Just remembered, they have plans for Hyderabad and Chandigarh as well!!!

Thanks to him for the expert observations!   Introduction\\nThe electric vehicle market in India has been steadily growing and offerings from many manufacturers are on sale in the country. Tata Motors leads the way with the Tigor EV (priced at Rs. 12.49 - 13.64 lakh) and Nexon EV (priced at Rs. 14.79 - 19.24 lakh), while MG sells the ZS EV (priced at Rs. 22.00 - 25.88 lakh), which is the most sorted EV this side of the luxury marques. There is also the Mini Electric, priced at 48.70 lakh. These cars are doing well in their respective price brackets and since there are no other electric models on offer in their segments, they are ruling unchallenged. \\nThen, there is a big price jump and the EVs in the next segment (Audi e-tron, BMW iX, Jaguar I-Pace and Mercedes EQC) are priced around Rs. 1 crore. \\nNow, Kia is entering the EV market in India with the EV6 “crossover”, which is aligned to what the company terms “Techno Green Innovation”. The car will be brought to India through the CBU route (VIN details indicated that the cars used for the drive at Buddh International Circuit were built in Korea). The EV6 will be positioned above the Carnival in Kia’s product portfolio, making it the new flagship product. During the presentation, there was reference to the Tesla Model Y, which should be an indicator as to how Kia plans to price the EV6. We expect it to be priced in the range of Rs. 60 - 75 lakh. This will mean that the car has no challengers in its price bracket, at least till the time the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Volvo XC40 Recharge are launched. Kia has allotted 100 units for the Indian market for the first year and bookings will open on May 26, 2022.  \\nThe EV6 is Kia’s first ground-up EV. It is based on Hyundai Group\\'s Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) and features Kia\\'s \"Opposites United\" design philosophy. It will be offered with a permanent magnet synchronous motor and a 77.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The battery supports ultra-fast charging, which adds 100 km of range in 4.5 minutes. It can be recharged from 10% - 80% in 18 minutes using a 350 kW fast charger (good luck finding that in India), while a 50 kW fast charger takes 73 minutes for the same. \\nKia claims that the EV6 offers a range of more than 500 km as per European test norms (AER). It is expected to manage perhaps over 500 km in ARAI tests. The car’s homologation is going on and the exact range will be announced during the launch on 2nd June.  \\nThe EV6 will be offered in the GT Line trim with both, single motor and dual-motor variants. The single motor RWD variant packs 226 BHP and 350 Nm, while the AWD version produces 222 BHP & 350 Nm at the front / 98 BHP & 255 Nm at the rear. That’s a combined output of a whopping 321 BHP and 605 Nm!  \\nThe exterior design is very bold and stylish with sleek lines and contours that run all along the body line + the bonnet. Smart use of design elements can be seen all over the car. For a change, everything somehow falls in place without anything glaringly standing out, which hasn\\'t been the case with many new cars. This car looks very sharp and would be well accepted by a wide audience, without polarising opinions. The EV6 rides on 19\" alloy wheels shod with 235/55 section tyres. What’s noteworthy is that the car’s ground clearance has been increased from 165 mm to 178 mm for India! Very, very important IMHO.  \\nThe car will come in 5 colours – Moonscape (our personal favourite), Snow White Pearl, Runaway Red, Aurora Black Pearl and Yacht Blue. The Aurora Black reminded me of my friend\\'s Standard (Rover) 2000, which he had painted shiny jet black, back in the 1990s.  \\nThe interiors, on the other hand, come in only one colour option, which is black. The quality and feel of the materials used is mostly very good and there are some nice, premium touches like the checkered finish on the passenger side of the dashboard and brushed aluminum on the central console. However, if you are expecting premium-class wood veneer and polished surfaces, you are in for a disappointment. On the other hand, you can expect everything to be well put together and long lasting, made with European flavor in abundance. While the cars used for our preview drive had different materials for the seats, the ones that will be sold in India will have black suede & off-white vegan leather upholstery. The choice of “vegan” is part of Kia’s green initiatives for the future. I found the front seats to be super comfortable. They have all the adjustments one will normally ask for. The seats are sporty and super supportive.  \\nWhile the black interiors will not get soiled easily, the dark shade of the upholstery along with the sloping roof line at the back, makes rear seat passengers feel claustrophobic. Rear legroom is abundant, especially with the front seats moved forward or even set for sub-6-foot-tall front users. The flat floor helps in extracting more space at the rear. The downside is that, with the overall raised floor due to the battery placement, the under-thigh support is negligible. This is not really a car for sitting in the rear seat on long drives. \\nLuggage space is good enough with a 520L boot, and a 20L (AWD) or 52L frunk (RWD). The boot floor has an additional removable section, which can increase the loading area depth by about 2 inches. It can also be used to store valuables out of sight. There is no spare wheel, not even a space saver! No tools provided either. This will pose major problems in real life driving conditions as India isn\\'t like Europe or USA where you can try roaming without a spare wheel. A subwoofer, along with the rest of the EV stuff, occupies the place of the spare wheel, jack and tools.  \\nOne needs to be cautious while folding the rear seatbacks from the boot. While it is super convenient, pulling the lever folds the seats rather hard and fast. So, if there are delicate items kept on the rear seat, expect them to be crushed. The folding mechanism is built tough, but that makes it equally tough to pull the seat back in place.  \\nThe young tech-savvy entrepreneur, who according to Kia is the potential customer, will expect a lot at the price at which the EV6 is likely to be launched. So, it is inevitable that the car has to be very well equipped. Kia has loaded the EV6 with all the features one would expect. Some of the features available include dual 12.3\" screens, 10-way power-adjustable front seats with memory function for the driver\\'s seat, suede & vegan leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, UV cut glasses, paddle shifters for regeneration, multi-drive modes, connected car technology, adaptive headlamps, rain-sensing wipers, vehicle-to-load and a wireless smartphone charger. The GT-Line AWD variant (which we drove) comes with an Augmented Reality head-up display, powered tailgate, sunroof (not panoramic), automatic flush-fitting door handles and a Meridian sound system with 14 speakers. \\nIf the geek in you wants to see what the 12.3\" screens can do, go ahead and check out this link. You scan a QR code on the system to get this link on your smartphone. Let me assure you that it will take at least half a Sunday for you to just go through the various menus and settings on this one. Good thing that most of them are, at best, 3-4 clicks deep. \\nOn the safety front, the EV6 comes equipped with 8 airbags, 360-degree camera, adaptive LED headlights, all-wheel disc brakes with ABS and brake assist, ESC, hill-start assist control, multi collision brake assist, VSM as well as ADAS. The list of ADAS features includes forward collision avoidance assist, lane keep assist, safe exit assist, lane follow assist, blind-spot detection with collision-avoidance assist, rear-cross traffic alert and smart cruise control with stop & go functionality. All the radar-based systems are configured for the real world and hence, would not work on a wide track like the Buddh International Circuit. Some of the instructors managed to get lane guidance working in a few corners. \\nYou will never run out of charging points in this car. You can use this EV as a massive power bank to charge your gadgets and gizmos...and then some. At the front, there are two USB ports, two 12V power outlets and a wireless charging pad. Rear passengers get two USB ports and one full-fledged 250V 16A power outlet. Then, there is another power outlet in the boot. If these are not enough, one can easily run any household appliance including a microwave, plasma TV and even a refrigerator using the Vehicle to Load (V2L) connection. We’re not kidding! The plasma TV used for the presentation was powered from the display car! One can even help fellow EV owners with a top up, if they run out of juice through a Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) connection using a regular ICCB cable.  Driving the Kia EV6 \\nIt was our bad luck that it started raining cats & dogs at 6.00 AM in Greater Noida, and when we reached the Buddh International Circuit at 7.00 AM, there was a full-fledged storm. At 9.00 AM, it was not clear whether the track would be opened for the drive. We saw steel plates flying off and falling in the pit area, barely missing an EV6. Things somehow mellowed down and it was decided that we will have a brief session on the track. We were reminded multiple times of the conditions; these were normal street cars and needed to be treated accordingly. We started with an instructor at the wheel for a demo drive on a short loop of Buddh. The track was wet, but the car behaved well with moderately aggressive turn-ins. The traction control system along with the electric motors, makes it very safe and does not allow for any unwanted spins or slips like internal combustion engine cars. It feels and is very safe that way.  \\nThen came my chance to have my two short laps of the circuit. The longer lap was yet to be cleared for driving. Turn the jog dial from P -> D and start off slowly. The EV6 will drive just like any other car, minus the sound from the engine. Mind you, the only EV I had tried before this was an Ather - a small, peppy scooter that goes off with a “wheeee”. But in an EV6, there is absolute silence. There is no whine or any other audio feedback, unless you switch on the electronics which play different themes over the speaker. I would personally keep them off and instead, switch on the relaxing tones option and enjoy the Zen-like calm. Depending on the pressure on the accelerator pedal, the power drive will be gentle, mild or shove you back into the seat . \\nThere are 3 driving modes: Eco - Feels like how a normal 150-180 BHP turbo-charged car would. Normal - Gives you about 30% more rush. While keeping the A-pedal at the same position, you hit the drive mode button on the steering wheel to engage Normal mode from Eco and the car will lunge forward eagerly with this change. There is a remarkable difference. Race - Lets all the kW’s into the motor and makes it a maniac. Expect yourself to be shoved back into the seat with the passengers screaming. We did a dash from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.6-ish seconds with 3 adults in the car. In a matter of seconds, you are doing silly speeds. This car has an electronically-limited top speed of 192 km/h and we could easily achieve that on the straight stretches of the track, even in wet conditions! There is absolutely no wheel spin or drama. The electric motor along with the electronics ensures that all the power is put on the ground and not even 1 kW is wasted. Snow - This mode is hidden. One needs to press and hold the mode button to activate it. We missed driving in this mode, but I guess it is for tricky, slippery conditions that you find in cold countries during the winter. The same mix of electric motors and the various stability programs can make the driving experience very uninvolving and boring on turns. In a normal internal combustion engine car, there is a lot of feedback that the driver will receive from the steering, engine, gearbox and brakes. In an EV, there is just the steering and then, the regen braking and normal brakes. The missing engine makes a huge difference to the driving experience for someone new to EVs.  \\nThe regenerative braking system has four levels, from mild to hard. This can be quickly accessed by using the paddles, which is well thought out. It’s just like using the paddles for downshifting to get more and more engine braking. In the highest regen mode, this vehicle can be driven with just the A-pedal. The regen braking can bring the vehicle to a stop. Hence, a keen and focussed driver would be able to recover a lot of lost energy during normal driving, enhancing the usable range. Then, there is “Auto” mode, which adjusts the regen braking based on various parameters including radar-guided cruise control (if activated) or on driver inputs. When I tried to use the paddles in Auto mode, the system kept flashing a message saying, “conditions are not met”, so I assume the paddles were being bypassed or the braking, along with the wet conditions, did not allow it to get more aggressive. Personally, I am a big fan of this regen braking, especially with the paddles. I felt that brings some fun and involvement into driving an EV. \\nHandling-wise, the car is very neutral. You can push it extremely well. I have driven normal ICE cars such as the Volkswagen Polo GTi, Jaguar F-Type, Mercedes AMG and BMW M cars, and ridden shotgun in Ferraris on tracks around the world and all of them need a good deal of driver attention in corners or they will bite back, squirm and squeal. The EV6 - on the other hand - just goes around corners like it’s on rails. The electronic aids plus the electric motor would be terrific for track times once people master it. Again, there is no intrusive traction control cutting in. It is all seamless. During the entire drive, only one momentary intervention I could sense was in the steering and that too when I took an aggressive turn + the wheels were on the wet kerbs. The whole car with its sound deadening, EV tech, etc. make it a very Zen-like place to be. One would love it or hate it, missing all the sensory feeling of riding in a normal motor car (sorry internal combustion engine car), while there would be others who appreciate the refinement.  \\nComing to the ride, the EV6 seems to be decent from our experience when we tried it on whatever undulated surfaces we could find inside the circuit, but it would be foolish to say it is great from just this drive. I feel the suspension set up is on the stiffer side, but definitely does not feel like a bone-jarring one. We\\'ll be driving this car on regular roads soon and will update the thread. \\nFront end features a sleek clamshell bonnet along with adaptive LED headlamps, and an angular lower bumper that accentuates the width of the car:  \\nRear is where you will see some bulk, but those LED lamps with a jewel like arrangement for the turn-indicators are pretty neat:  \\nThe side is the best angle to view the car from, with the character lines clearly visible. There is a silhouette puddle light that is hidden on the C-pillar (yes, C-pillar):  \\nCloser look at the headlamp cluster with integrated multi-array front indicators:  \\nFully protected and absolutely flat undercarriage.

Otherwise, they look like brushed aluminium jewels. Neat touch:  \\nHere is the EV6 in the Aurora Black Pearl paint. How many of you are reminded of the Standard 2000? A modern take on it, I feel:   \\nInteriors are clean and elegant. Everything is well put together, with the right amount of stylish inserts:  \\nThe displays seem to be the right size and not just a huge tablet in your face. There are two screens here - one for the infotainment head-unit and a second one for the instrument cluster:  \\nSeats have the right bolstering and the headrest is not intrusive, although it looks like the face of ET:  \\nThis is the Zero G position of the front seats where one can relax, while getting a quick top up. We rate it A+. It\\'s very comfortable without any pressure applied on the back. However, operating the switch to do it right is not easy:  \\nTouch controls have a mode button where the function changes from HVAC to media. This is tricky at first, yet easy to get used to and efficient use of space. Still, people may accidentally turn up the temperature instead of the volume:  \\nIt is a maze under the dash and you can see the power lines too:  \\nThe downside of all the design touches and battery being underneath. Your leg will get dirty if you are not careful. Shorter folks will find it a stretch to reach the ground:  \\nNormally, the rear passenger has negligible under-thigh support:  \\nWith the front seat pushed ahead, the rear passenger can stretch his legs and then, the under-thigh support is alright. But this is not a very comfortable position to sit in for long:  \\nThis is not a large sneaker that I am wearing, yet there is no place underneath the front seat to put my feet:  \\n250V, 16A socket is a rare phenomenon even at homes as it is used only for heavy appliances. You can set up a full fledged office with this:  \\nSmall quarter glasses are the biggest reason to find it claustrophobic at the rear. Passengers will have their heads next to them while they are seated:  \\nNo dearth of space to carry that stuff for weekend camping. Rear seatbacks fold forward in a 60:40 ratio:  \\nNotice the removeable boot floor. You can get 2 more inches of depth. Can store some valuables away from prying eyes here:  \\nFolding the rear seat backrests gives you a luggage capacity of 1,300 liters. You can remove the parcel shelf. A camping bed can be easily accommodated along with a sleeping bag:  \\n20-liter frunk is pretty much useless. That is an iPhone X kept in it to give you an idea about its size:  \\nKia claims this is India\\'s fastest charger with all of 180 kW and set up at Buddh.

It is available at 15 dealerships across 12 cities and the booking amount has been set at Rs 3 lakh.   \\nKia initially plans to import 100 units via the CBU route. The car is available in a single GT Line trim. The official launch will take place next month. \\nThe Kia EV6 is based on the Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP). It comes with a permanent magnet synchronous motor and a 77.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that is said to offer a maximum range of 528 km (WLTP cycle). The battery supports ultra-fast charging, which adds 100 km of range in 4.5 minutes. It can be recharged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes using a 350 kW fast charger, while a 50 kW fast charger takes 73 minutes. \\nIn India, the EV6 is offered in single motor and dual-motor variants. The single motor RWD variant packs 226 BHP and 350 Nm, while the AWD version produces 321 BHP and 605 Nm. \\nThe Kia EV6 comes equipped with LED headlamps with Adaptive Driving Beam and Connected LED tail lamps with sequential turn indicators. The car rides on 19-inch alloy wheels. \\nInside, the EV6 gets panoramic dual 12.3-inch curved displays, a head-up display, a Meridian sound system with 14 speakers, an electric sunroof, seats that recline at a press of a button and cruise control with stop & go functionality.', \"Great review. It had all the details one could ask for.  \\nThis has now replaced my dream of a BMW 3 series. The muscle car looks and performance that can smoke even supercars.

And what do you think about resales of EV more so, say an EV6 vs an i4?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nTo address the questions you raised:   Will someone buy a Kia for (say) 60L - 70L. \\nI think the market has already crossed the point of maturity where buyers are willing to pay German car like money for non German / non luxury marquees.  The Camry and Fortuner are two examples.  One may say strong Toyota brand for those two examples, to which closer home, Kia too has established that POC to some extent via the Carnival.  \\nIf the product is specced right, built right, and priced (within reason) right, I think people will not reject it merely because its a Kia.  Lack of direct luxury competition sometimes also helps.   \\nIf I was in the market today for an EV with a 60-70 lakh budget and my choices were the XC 40 Charge vs the EV6 / Ioniq, I would not pick the Volvo merely because its Volvo or reject the Kia / Hyundai merely because of the badge.  I’d judge each on its individual merits.  From images at least, I feel the Kia really hits the sweet spot on every metric that I value.   \\nThe back seat seems acceptably comfortable, the front for my small frame should be adequate, it has the right level of range, great luggage space with good modular flexibility and decent crossover spec ground clearance. The fact that it almost looks like a muscle car and has been very tastefully designed only strengthens its case.   \\nThe issue of course is that its just that tad bit pricey (specially in MH) being a CBU.  If this was within 60L on road, I’d actively consider it if I was in the market and it ticked all other boxes right.    Resale \\nHard to comment on this.  These are niche products released in limited numbers at prices not palatable to everyone.  \\nOne way to look at this: the combination of these factors means there should at least be some demand for this in the used market as well given that units coming up for resale will be limited and the depreciated price at which these could hit the market might be more palatable to a slighter wider group set.   \\nThe counter argument is that the market is deepening and more offerings will come across a broader price range.  If that is the case, buyers might have many more new car options as the market deepens and expensive initial offerings like an i4 would have to compete with a new offering like Kia EV6.  Heck, even a 2 year old Kia EV6 may have to compete with a brand new Ioniq that might be meaningfully cheaper and substantially similar.   \\nI think it’ll depend on product by product but this here sounds like the more real threat to expensive new EVs purchased in 2022/ 23.', \"I think Kia will sell these 100 cars in no time. It's an easy and very obvious choice for the well-heeled looking to add an EV flavour to their well-stocked garage. The stock will be sold out by the time discerning buyers/fence-sitters make up their mind. \\nHaving said that it's not such an easy decision for those looking for their main car as it's difficult to rule out the product offerings from EU cars. It's best not to do any FOMO (fear of missing out) purchase and explore options with patience. Things will only get better when it comes to EV cars (not sure about the prices!!)\", 'Kia won\\'t want to sell over 100 cars and I doubt they can. In many big markets (e.g. USA), the EV6 has a waiting list and some dealers are selling it for ABOVE MSRP prices. In Australia, the car is apparently sold out until 2025 (1500 orders).  \\nConsidering the lack of options between the MG ZS EV and the luxury marques, all 100 allocations of the EV6 will be done for soon.  \\nThis is simply a \"halo\" / marketing product to add some more shine to the brand. It\\'s not about sales numbers at all.', \"Kia has another blockbuster in its kitty with this EV6.

Such is the demand for the car it is even difficult to get a test drive and currently has 14 months waiting period.  \\r\\nFrom the pictures, i expected it to be a hatchback, maybe a little larger than VW Golf but I was wrong. The photos are deceiving, the car is huge - wheelbase is as long as Kia Telluride. I expected it to handle like a hot hatch. If we benchmark it against such hot hatches, EV6 is a disappointment. Once you realize are riding around in a 1.9 ton CSUV, you really start to appreciate the handling of RWD EV6. You can notice some body roll in the curves but it is on a league of its own if you benchmark it against any ICE CSUVs currently in the market. For a car weighing close to 2 tons, it is very brisk and regen does its job. Even when you press the pedal hard, there was no wheel slip at the rear at all. It is a wonderfully engineered car (or should one say SUV). If i had one complaint though, it was the steering feedback. In all the drive modes, i never felt connected to the road and was vague.

Our market is too small to manufacture EVs locally at the present time. Even CKD operations would still cost companies a lot more than they'll earn. Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, BMW bringing in much more affordable cars is definitely a sign of good things to come. Hopefully in a duty cut, maybe even local manufacturing to some extent. It is tougher to do with a BEV. Maybe cars like the XC40 and BMW ix3 which share the platform with ICE counterparts can be made here in CKD guise. Only time will tell though.

Not a car you just get into and start driving  This review has been jointly compiled with Vid6639. Thanks to him for the expert observations.   Introduction \\nThe EQS is the first Mercedes-Benz car that has been developed exclusively as an Electric Vehicle. Earlier this year, moderators vb-san and ajmat drove the EQS 580 4Matic and the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ in Germany and India, respectively. \\nIn August, Mercedes launched the AMG EQS 53 4Matic+ in India, and now, the company has introduced the EQS 580 4Matic. While the former is imported as a CBU, the latter is brought via the CKD route.  \\nThe EQS 580 4 Matic comes with two electric motors - one on each axle, and together, they produce 516 BHP and 855 Nm torque. These figures, along with the fact this is an EV (= instant and always-available torque), mean that you will giggle like a little baby when you floor the A pedal. The motors are powered by a 107.8 kWh battery pack, which will take you 600+ km on a single charge. That's Mumbai - Goa on a single charge. This also means you can do Mumbai - Pune - Mumbai twice or Delhi - Jaipur - Delhi or once. The likelihood of you doing that is slightly remote though. The motors get you from 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds, while the car's top speed is limited to 210 km/h.  \\nThe battery pack comes with an 8-year / unlimited km warranty and the service interval is 2 years / 30,000 km.\", 'Exterior  \\nMassive three-pointed star logo on the grille houses the front camera. The bonnet can only be opened / removed through a hidden, undisclosed lever under the dashboard. It is not supposed to be opened by the user and only by service personnel:   \\nThe rear gets 3D helix design elements in the LED tail-lamps:  \\nThe EQS is built on a dedicated EV platform and to accommodate a larger battery pack, the wheels are pushed to the edges, which means a massive 3,210mm wheelbase:  \\nWith a drag coefficient of 0.20, the EQS is claimed to be the most aerodynamic production car in the world. The swooping lines really turn heads on the road as well:  \\nAt the rear, you get a light bar connecting the tail-light clusters. Badging is distributed between the left and right:  \\nEach multi-beam headlight cluster uses Mercedes\\'s Digital Light Technology, which consists of a light module with three extremely powerful LEDs, whose light is refracted and directed by 1.3 million micro-mirrors. The resolution is therefore more than 2.6 million pixels per vehicle. The new headlamp can be recognized by its concave lens and the blue illuminated Mercedes-Benz lettering:  \\nPiano black panel with three-pointed star detailing in place of a radiator grille. The entire grille is illuminated with every small three-pointed star glowing in blue:  \\nORVMs house cameras for the 360-degree camera system and also puddle lamps that project the Mercedes-Benz branding:  \\nProminent EQS badging on the A-pillar:  \\nGiven that the bonnet is sealed, here\\'s where you put in the windscreen washer fluid. Press to open, while the car is unlocked:  \\nDoor handles remain flush with the door panels when locked. They will pop out when they sense proximity to the key, or when you press the request sensor on the handle. The downside to this is that if you\\'re standing close to the car with the key on you, the door handles will keep popping out:   \\nDoor handles get illumination:   \\nFrameless front and rear doors look great and add to the cool quotient of the overall design:  \\n20-inch wheels shod with 225/45 section Pirelli P Zero tyres. Luckily Mercedes didn\\'t opt for the 21 inchers that vb-san drove in Germany. The higher profile is a boon on our roads:  \\nCharging port is placed on the rear flank:  \\nGround clearance is not even enough to clear a typical 6.5\" phone:  \\nThe party trick of the EQS - 4-wheel steering! The car is 5,216 mm long with a wheelbase of 3,210 mm, but the 4-wheel steering makes those in-between-divider turns in the city effortless. Its turning circle of 10.9 m is lesser than the C-Class!  \\nWith the tail-lamps in action. Press the Mercedes-Benz logo to open the boot. It houses a Passat-style reversing camera: ', 'Interior\\nThe EQS 580 comes in two interior colour options - white and black. As you step into the cabin, you are greeted with a sea of screens that run the length of the dashboard. The screens on the passenger side and centre fascia are touch-enabled, while the one for the driver is controlled via the switches on the steering wheel - the ones on the right spoke to be specific. The switches on the left spoke control the infotainment head-unit, which can also be accessed through the controls near the armrest:  \\nLeather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel allows you to control everything in the car through the switches on the left and right spokes. These controls are touch-enabled, mind you and there\\'s a good chance you do something you didn\\'t intend to, as your hand moves the wheel. Paddle shifters allow you to toggle between the various regeneration modes - the left between Off & Normal, and the right between Intelligent & Strong:  \\nFully digital instrument cluster displays a host of information from driving parameters, navigation, driving modes and driving assist features. Remember, there\\'s no augmented reality in the Indian EQS:  \\nControls for the lights and parking brake are placed on the right of the steering wheel:  \\nDriver\\'s doorpad houses controls for the electrically adjustable seat, memory, heating & cooling and massage functions, door lock/unlock, ORVM adjustment and the hatch:  \\nSeating is low and one feels cocooned in. The front seats have limited adjustment:  \\nCentre fascia is the command centre of the car. A/C controls are touch-enabled:  \\nYou can control driver personalisation options, car settings, entertainment, driving and safety features and so on:  \\nHere\\'s a party trick. When you select the multi-colour option in ambient lighting, the lights on the door pads have their own little show going on! Very, very cool:  \\nThey tell you the direction of energy transfer - whether from the battery to the wheel, or the other way around:  \\nIf you are about to turn and there is someone in your blind spot (also displayed on the ORVM), the lights will flash in red to warn you:  \\nCentre console houses another set of controls - driver profile fingerprint scanner, engine start/stop button, driving modes, volume, 360-degree camera display and a shortcut to the car settings:  \\nUnder the armrest is a storage bin with two USB-C charging points and a wireless charging pad:   \\nRear doorpad houses switches for controlling seat heating & cooling functions and adjustment:  \\nA generous amount of ambient lighting even at the rear:  \\nThe rear seats can recline and are ventilated, but do not get a massage function. The middle passenger also gets a full-size headrest:  \\nLegroom in the rear is abundant:  \\nArmrest has a storage bin along with two USB-C ports and a wireless charging pad. It also houses a Samsung tab that has all the controls as the infotainment head-unit. Mercedes has not bothered to remove the Samsung branding:  \\nHeadroom is sufficient. At 6\\' 2\", Vid6639 was comfortable. However, sitting upright, there wasn\\'t much clearance left, which is typical of most luxury cars that have a coupe design:  \\nIndividual A/C controls for the rear passengers and a smaller storage area along with two USB-C ports. Climate control system has a HEPA filter that maintains interior AQI to about 1 PM2.5:  \\nFront seatbacks have small pockets to stow the sahib\\'s magazines:  \\nThe EQS is a notchback so the opening is huge. Luggage space is enormous!   \\nNo spare tyre. Instead, there is a shallow underfloor tray to store the charging cables:  \\nButtons to close / adjust the boot opening height: ', 'Driving the EQS 580 4Matic\\nThe 107.8 kWh battery churns out an exciting 516 BHP and a gut-wrenching 855 Nm through 2 electric motors. Press the power button after you have set your profile with biometrics (or Face ID) and you get a \"READY\" light on the instrument cluster indicating that the EQS is all set. Press the throttle normally as you would in any car and the EQS moves off the line silently and smoothly. It\\'s very usable and smooth inside the city with normal throttle inputs. As with any EV, the torque is instant and overtaking is a breeze. You can close gaps in traffic with a slight nudge to the throttle and with no delay. It makes the experience of driving this 5.2 m long 2.5 ton behemoth effortless.  \\nThe accelerator pedal is easy to operate initially, but it has a lot more weight / resistance as you push it further and when you do floor it, you will know why. Press hard down, and I do not exaggerate when I say this, your stomach will curl as the electric motors work their magic. The acceleration is intense and brutal on your senses. Vid6639 punched the throttle when I wasn\\'t expecting and it was like someone punching you into the seat. A 0-100 km/h time of 4.3 secs in something so big and heavy is like defying the laws of physics. Of course, Tesla owners are used to it, but in India, this is still rare with not many fast EVs around. Once you taste this acceleration, it becomes addictive and you keep doing it just to experience the insane \"whoosh\". It makes overtaking on single-carriageways ridiculously easy. The fun is mainly between 0-120 km/h. The EQS will comfortably touch 210 km/h, which is the limited top speed (we, obviously, didn\\'t test this).  \\nThe EQS comes with four driving modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport and Individual. As with most luxury cars, the steering, throttle response and suspension settings change depending on the drive mode engaged. Sport mode gives the steering a lot more weight and makes the throttle ridiculously sensitive. This mode is not even an option to try inside town. Most of the time, we drove in Comfort mode and it was more than enough. In the Individual mode, you can configure each of the parameters to your preference and save it for whenever you want to engage it again. \\nIn Sport mode, you can also enable ambient sounds. It\\'s a very gimmicky feature but adds a cool factor to it. There are 2 sounds - \"Silver Waves\" and \"Vivid Flux\" - to choose from. When you press the throttle, the sound coming from the speakers is like a spaceship taking off and very sci-fi.   Range and Charging \\nWhile the range of 850 km sounds impressive, this is based on the MIDC or ARAI-based calculation. The real-world range will be closer to the WLTP figure of 677 km. After driving the EQS 580 for the better part of the day, we are very confident that anyone can do 600+ km on a full charge unless you drive like a complete hooligan, flooring the A pedal at every opportunity (like Vid6639). \\nThis sort of range takes away any range anxiety. This one-charge driving distance lets you complete road trips on most popular routes easily. We got the car when it had a range of ~ 650 km and after our drive, which included Chakan-Lonavala-Khopoli and then through the city, there was still ~ 350 km left. Mind you, this was across a jammed Pune-Mumbai Expressway, peak-hour bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city, and a generous amount of really flooring the A pedal many, many times (in the interest of testing of course). \\nThe battery comes with both AC and DC charging ports. A 15 minute quick charge gets you 300 km of range provided you use the fast DC charger. A full charge, using a 15A socket, will take more than a day. So, you will need at least a 3 phase fast charger at home. Alternately, with this sort of range, you may only be charging the car 2-3 times a month, which can be managed at a dealership or any fast charger en route. The fact that daily charging is not needed with this range, is really a game changer for EVs.   Suspension Ride and Handling \\nThe EQS gets Mercedes AIRMATIC air suspension with adaptive dampers known as ADS+. The system is similar to what you get in the S-Class. Using sensors at the front, the car detects the road surface and sets the damping at each wheel dynamically. As a result, the EQS rides very plush at slow speeds and when pushed, doesn\\'t roll a lot in spite of its weight. There is a firm edge to the suspension, which is noticeable when you hit a sharp bump hard. But other than that, nothing much filters into the cabin especially in Comfort mode. Everything tightens up in Sport mode with more of the surface being transmitted inside the cabin. But the ride becomes a lot flatter as speeds go up. \\nThe AIRMATIC system also keeps the ride height constant. Based on the load, the ground clearance is maintained at the same level. At speeds below 40 km/h, you can raise the height by 25 mm for speed breakers, but even in the raised position, the ground clearance is nothing to write home about. We scraped plenty of speed breakers including some that most cars could glide over. The huge 3,210 mm wheelbase makes it even more tricky as it is not even possible to take some speed breakers diagonally. This is not a car for most Indian cities. The USP is that every time you raise the height, it saves the GPS coordinates of the position where it was raised and the next time, the car will raise the height on its own at that location - very handy and useful. Once you cross 50 km/h, it goes back to its normal ride height. However, above 120 km/h, it drops by 10 mm and above 160 km/h it drops by a further 10 mm. God bless the underbody if you hit a rough patch doing 120 km/h!  \\nThanks to the weight of the battery on the floor, the handling and body control of the EQS are surprisingly good. It\\'s no S-Class in terms of dynamics and this is in a good way. GTO was driving the EQS and we followed him down the Lonavala ghat in his BMW 530D and were amazed to see the cornering speeds it could do and how flat the car was with hardly any lean through the turns even at higher speeds. You can chuck it into bends and not even realise that this is a 2.5 ton barge.  \\nThe best part is the steering. Thanks to the 4-wheel steering system, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheel at slow speeds and in the same direction at speeds above 60 km/h. This means that in sharp corners, you can flick the EQS like a C-Class and as speeds build up, you have more steering control. This also helps in city manoeuvrability as the rear wheels can turn by 10 degrees in the opposite direction as the front. However, Mercedes-Benz is being cheeky here and taking a leaf out of BMW\\'s books. The 10-degree steering is a paid subscription option and you only get 4 degrees as standard. However, as an introductory offer, Mercedes will offer this for free on the first 500 cars sold in India. It\\'s something you realise is needed when taking a U-turn or parking in tight spaces as the turning diameter is just 10.9 m with the 10-degree option, which is lesser than the C-Class and more in the league of compact cars.  \\nThere\\'s no denying the fact that this is a large and heavy car, but with the weight low down and the suspension and steering tech, the EQS is a lot more fun than the luxury S-Class and the E-Class LWB.   Braking \\nAs I drove out of the Chakan plant, I pointed to Vid6639 how the braking wasn\\'t very intuitive and reassuring. At the top of his hat, he attributed that to the regeneration braking feature and the electric servo vs the hydraulic servo in ICE cars. While this was probably the case, the pedal just felt too spongy and vague. With the kind of acceleration the EQS has, the brakes are a letdown. They just don\\'t inspire confidence. However, the braking, when ADAS is on, is very, very strong and much more reassuring than you pressing down on the pedal. As with EVs, the initial braking is taken care of by the regen after which, the disc brakes take over.  \\nThe EQS gets three regeneration braking modes apart from switching off regen completely: \\n1) Normal: This is the normal setting with a mild level of regen\\n2) Strong: This is a very aggressive form of regeneration where taking the foot off the accelerator implies mild/strong braking. In this mode not only do the brake lights turn on when you lift off the throttle, but the brake pedal gets depressed as well!\\n3) Intelligent: This is a mix of Normal / Strong depending on the car\\'s computer deciding when to use what.  \\nAll the regen modes are toggled using the paddle shifters.  \\nThe Intelligent mode is as good as useless as the car keeps toggling between Normal and Strong, which won\\'t give you a good sense of how much you need to brake. With the pedal sometimes moving away from your foot and the system going into Strong regen, you are kept guessing how much braking the car will apply vs how much pedal input is needed. You will land up slowing down too much before a traffic light or speed breaker and sometimes realise that you have to brake manually as the system is in Normal regen.  \\nThe Strong regen mode can be enabled by a flick of the left paddle and is very useful when slowing down in emergency situations or when you are driving aggressively and braking harder intentionally. It\\'s very useful in the ghats before a hairpin bend. \\nIrrespective of all these regen modes, GTO, Vid6639 and myself all were unimpressed with the overall braking. There also should be a regen mode between normal and strong, which would be more useful than the intelligent mode. \\nThe EQS 580 gets the full suite of safety features that are available in the S-Class. This includes Active Steering Assist, 9 Airbags, 360-degree camera, Driving Assistance and more. GTO likes to switch off all these aids and sensors given how ill-suited they are to Indian driving conditions and rightly so. For instance, Automatic Braking / Collision Avoidance can be a huge nuisance and safety hazard (yep, the irony) as you drive in our cities. When you have all sorts of animals and vehicles randomly appearing in front / alongside you, this feature runs you the risk of being rear-ended, given how we don\\'t like to give each other much space.

A range of 650 km (I'm guessing a usable range of 550-580 kms) means it is actually possible to take the EQS for long-distance highway trips, even in a country like India where the charging points are few and far between. Really hope this will trickle down to cheaper cars - already the EQE350+ has an impressive range of 650 km+ and will almost surely be a hit since it will also be cheaper than the equivalent E class.  \\nAlso, I wonder why only Mercedes and Silicon Valley companies like Tesla and Lucid have been able to breach the 600 km mark!

In this scenario the regen level is maximized such that the vehicle naturally retards away from such a situation which will both regenerate energy as well as reduce braking effort.

            "[\"While sub 30L EVs choices are still quite limited now, my major choice between MG ZS and Nexon EV was, like most other buyers, range anxiety. Nexon looks decent, almost 8L cheaper lost because talking to some owners gave me worries about being less 250KM on full charge. 250 is a distance that's not bad for city drivers. But given how EV Charging infrastructure is in India right now seemed risky.  Some users do claim 300 Range on EV MAX but when I checked in their App stats that seemed like far fetched claim. Glad to have chosen MG ZS though the cost was quite higher. ARAI claim was 461KM but after crossing 2000 KM on my MG including a 1000KM long drive I can pretty much have a honest stat to provide. \\n\\nCity driving: You will easily get 320-350 depending on your driving habit.\\nHighway driving: if you drive well, utilizing cruise controls, non-aggressive accelerations, KERS braking  you can easily get 380-400. \\nHaving sunroof a little open or AC on internal circulation, you can conserve range well.   But you will definitely sacrifice somewhat 20-30KM.\\n\\nPerformance: Well, ECO mode is what you mostly need, Normal has a lot of power. Sports mode, save it for afterlife. the car never feels lacking power even in Eco mode. In fact, Steep office parking ramps are easily overpowered in ECO mode itself. I have done 150 Km/h in eco mode easily. Haven't tried that in SPORTS.  Hill driving is smooth. There is hill decent assist as well. Auto brakes assist not rolling backwards. Superb easy to drive.\\n\\nLooks: Car looks great from front (Minus the front grill that they have reworked out of Astor, made of flimsy plastic. you can bend it with single finger press ). I really hope MG redoes the front grill for ZS EV. The back is really ordinary. Nothing of it looks like a 28L+ car.  No Fog lamps (WTF MG), Headlights are decent (Expected more lumens). Panoramic Sun roof is great. Interior is pretty good, premium  and organized.\\n\\nFeatures: No complains. Although 360 camera is pretty bad quality, not very useful other than kind of guessing what's being shown, you cannot guess how far things are on the sides. Images are very very distorted.  But getting to see your wheels help.\\n\\nComfort: Expected better stabilized soft suspensions. The car has higher ground clearance, therefore every pothole shakes your whole body like some weird dance move.   Seats are comfortable premium leather. But not ventilated. Long trips make you sweat a lot. \\n\\nOverall verdict:  A great car but at a premium price. To compete with all the upcoming EVs MG needs to bring  it down to a rational level.

Thanks to them for the expert observations!  Introduction \\r\\nLet us tell you one thing straight up = the MG ZS EV is the most sorted electric car sold in India (this side of the luxury marques, of course). It is considerably more expensive than the Nexon EV, yes, but if you can afford it, the price premium is well worth it. The MG ZS EV will make you glee; go for a test-drive and then come back to comment on this thread.  \\r\\nFirst launched in January 2020, the ZS EV has won its share of fans. MG just brought in the facelift you see here and the changes aren\\'t merely cosmetic. The facelift comes with a bigger battery pack with a claimed range of 461 km, a new, more powerful motor that makes 174 BHP & 280 Nm, along with some new features.  MG ZS EV Price & Brochure\\r\\nMG has launched the ZS EV facelift at Rs. 22.00 lakh for the Excite variant (which will be available from July 2022) and Rs. 25.88 lakh for the Exclusive variant. Important to note that the MG Astor - which can be seen as the petrol variant of the ZS EV - is priced from Rs. 9.98 lakh to Rs. 17.73 lakh. Essentially, with the ZS EV, you are paying the premium for electric technology and being an early adopter of the same.  \\r\\nYou can download the MG ZS EV brochure here - MG ZS EV Brochure.pdf  Incentives \\r\\nApart from the central government\\'s incentives, states are offering additional perks to promote the use of electric vehicles. In Maharashtra and Delhi, registration and road tax have been waived off on all EVs. Furthermore, individuals can avail of income tax benefits under section 80EEB (only applicable for vehicles registered by individuals) - click here to read a detailed article on the same.   Running Costs \\r\\nEVs have come to be known for the magical number of \"1 rupee per km\". With the facelift, MG has increased the battery capacity of the ZS EV from 44.5 kWh to 50.3 kWh.  This means it will need 50 units of electricity for a 100% charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it\\x92s about Rs. 8 per unit. This translates to Rs. 400 for a full charge. MG claims a range of 461 km on a full charge and in the real world, if one drives conservatively, 350 (realistic) - 400 km (if you drive like a miser) are obtainable. Thus, the approximate Rs. 1 per km running cost holds true for the ZS EV as well.   Want to know more about EVs?  Be sure to read GTO\\'s excellent article (Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head) on the topic.', 'Exterior   Design & Styling \\r\\nIn most cases, the facelift of a car looks better than the previous version. I\\'m not sure if that\\'s true with the MG ZS EV - you may or may not agree with me. While the car still looks neat overall, the front of the ZS EV is going to polarise opinions for sure. Gone is the Mercedes-like grille with chrome inserts. There is a solid front grille, which is more in line with those seen on electric cars, the bumper has been changed and the headlights have been re-profiled. The face now looks rather stubby. The rear, on the other hand, looks very smart with sleek LED tail-lamps and a new bumper with neatly integrated reflectors.   Build Quality, Fit & Finish \\r\\nThe ZS EV is a well-built car. The panel shut lines are tight and there\\'s not much flex in the body panels. The doors and bonnet have a good amount of heft to them and the car feels sturdy overall.   Wheels & Tyres \\r\\nThe ZS EV is equipped with 17\" alloy wheels that are shod with 215/55 section tyres. Our test car was shod with Michelin Primacy 3 ST rubber. The recommended tyre pressure is a whopping 41 PSI all around, which has been done to maximise the range.  \\r\\nIf you are going to drive it like an enthusiast, you might want to consider wider tyres. The torque on tap is enough to make the tyres slide under hard driving.   Standard & Extended Warranty \\r\\nThe ZS EV is offered with MG e-Shield under which you get a 5 year / unlimited km warranty, 5 years of roadside assistance and 5 labour-free services. Apart from this, you also get an 8 year / 150,000 km warranty on the battery.   Safety \\r\\nThe ZS EV gets a host of safety features like 6 airbags, electronic stability control, ABS + EBD + Brake Assist, emergency stop signal, hill start assist, hill descent control, electronic parking brake with auto hold, ISOFIX child seat anchors, tyre pressure monitoring system and all-round disc brakes. Additionally, you get a 360-degree camera, rear-drive assist (blind-spot detection system, rear cross-traffic alert & lane change assist), heated ORVMs and pedestrian warning system.  \\r\\nThe pre-facelift version got a 5-star rating at the Euro NCAP, and we\\'re sure that this facelift will perform similarly. MG better not have made any \"India specific\" or localization changes (which is industry speak for cheapening the product).', 'Interior   Cabin Design & Quality \\r\\nIf you\\'ve been in the pre-facelift car, you\\'ll appreciate how MG has cleverly improved the cabin. For starters, there\\'s an additional soft leather insert running across the dashboard with a carbon-fibre finish and contrast red stitching that looks / feels brilliant. Plenty of soft-touch elements give the cabin a premium feel. The lower part of the dashboard has hard plastics, but of good quality. Overall, the interiors feel solid and well built, although they don\\'t have that \"wow\" factor of the Astor\\'s red cabin.  \\r\\nIn terms of design, the dashboard and centre console look uncluttered, thanks to the absence of a conventional gear lever and the use of an electronic parking brake.     Space & Comfort \\r\\nThere\\'s a fair amount of space available. The big leather front seats are super comfy and accommodating. The cushioning is slightly on the softer side. They offer good under-thigh and side support to keep you in place on twisty roads.   Driving Position & Ergonomics \\r\\nGetting comfortable in the driver\\'s seat is easy with the ZS EV. The flat-bottom steering wheel is carried over from the earlier car and is lovely to hold. Feels very German. Sadly, it\\'s adjustable only for height and not reach! The driver\\'s seat is 6-way power-adjustable with a healthy range. Hence, finding your perfect driving position shouldn\\'t be a problem. The frontal visibility is good and you get a good view of the road while driving. All the controls are where you\\'d expect them to be and are easily reachable.  Cabin Storage \\r\\nThe absence of a handbrake and traditional gear lever has freed up a lot of space in the centre console. There are the usual cupholders, a storage bin under the centre armrest and a spot with a wireless charging pad for keeping your smartphone. Apart from this, all the door pockets are deep and can hold a 1-litre bottle, along with some other knick-knacks. The glovebox is average-sized. We wish it were more spacious. There are two cupholders in the new centre armrest for rear passengers to use.   Air-Conditioning \\r\\nIn the hot and humid weather of Mumbai, the ZS EV\\'s air-con performed very well. There\\'s a noticeable drop in the performance of the air-con while driving in ECO mode though. The system gets a PM 2.5 filter, which in today\\'s day and age is a necessity in the metro cities.   Features Unique & Noteworthy Features \\r\\nMG is known to pack its cars with features and the ZS EV is no different. You get a 7\" fully digital instrument cluster, a panoramic sunroof, auto headlamps, auto wipers, a 360-degree camera (mediocre display quality), heated ORVMs, drive modes, rear-drive assist features and i-Smart connected car features. What the ZS EV misses out on is an auto-dimming IRVM, ventilated seats and wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto. We would have also liked it if MG offered the adaptive cruise control system from the Astor.   Audio System & Sound Quality \\r\\nThe 10\" infotainment system, like before, has a simple and user-friendly interface. You will get used to it in no time. The display is crisp with a good contrast of colours and even under direct sunlight, visibility is good. The 6-speaker (4 speakers + 2 tweeters) sound system just about makes the cut. In terms of sound quality, there\\'s nothing to write home about for the 25-lakh price.     Rear Passengers   Rear Seat Comfort & Space \\r\\nThe ZS EV isn\\'t as low as a hatchback nor is it as high as some of the conventional SUVs. So, getting in and out is an easy affair. You slide in and out of the rear seats with ease. You get 3 soft, adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers. But it\\'s really just better if the third occupant is a child and not an adult.  \\r\\nThere\\'s a decent amount of knee room and headroom for rear passengers. At 5\\'10\", I could sit behind my driving position with some knee room to spare. I\\'d have felt more comfortable with a little more under-thigh support though. Shorter people will find the under-thigh support comfortable, but taller occupants will find it lacking. New to the facelift is the rear centre armrest, which is wide and also houses 2 cup holders. Rear passengers get air-con vents, a regular USB port and a Type-C USB port.     Boot Space \\r\\nThe boot is large enough to carry a family\\'s weekend luggage. The 60:40 split rear seats can be folded down to increase cargo space.', 'Driving the MG ZS EV\\r\\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor puts out 174 BHP & 280 Nm of torque. Compared to the previous car, the facelift makes 33 BHP more, but 73 Nm less! It\\'s still as quick though:  \\r\\nBefore we get to the driving part, let\\x92s get the basics right. There are 3 main components in an EV \\x96 the battery, the motor and the controller/charger. The battery is what stores the energy and the motor is what uses that energy to move the car. The controller/charger converts the energy from the battery into a usable form to power the motor. In more technical terms, the power grid from your house or a charging station is usually an AC. The lithium-ion battery can store electric energy in DC form. So while charging, there\\x92s usually an AC/DC converter that will convert the power grid\\'s AC into DC and store it in the car\\x92s battery. The DC fast chargers that you see, usually have the AC/DC converter inbuilt, which is how they can charge the car\\x92s battery faster. The controller typically sits on top of the motor.  \\r\\nDriving an EV is quite a unique experience and recent EVs have all been impressive. Push the engine start button with your foot on the brake pedal and you\\'ll hear nothing, although the car is \"alive\" now. There are four transmission modes to choose from \\x96 P, D, R and N. Turn the classy rotary dial to engage D, lift your foot off the brake pedal and the car crawls forward at 6 km/h. This will be highly appreciated in heavy traffic conditions where you can drive with just the brake pedal. I had the privilege of getting stuck in Mumbai\\'s Western Express Highway weekend traffic for about 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it wasn\\'t that bad crawling in the bumper-to-bumper traffic.  \\r\\nDriving in the city is a pleasant experience. The accelerator pedal\\'s response is linear and not snappy (especially in Eco mode). Passengers will appreciate how smooth the drive feels, without any jerks caused by gearshifts or any engine sounds. It is an incredibly refined experience.  \\r\\nGet on some open city roads, floor the A pedal and you\\'ll be greeted with instant power / acceleration. This is the beauty of powerful electric motors. The car is fast and has abundant torque right from the get-go. In fact, the acceleration is so strong that, in all of the silly childish drag races at traffic lights, you will always win. MG claims a 0-100 km/h time of 8.5 seconds (same as the previous car) and we believe that. To put that timing in perspective, the ZS EV is faster than the Creta, Seltos, Astor etc., but not something like the Octavia which is 0.5 seconds quicker to 100. The MG ZS EV is genuinely enjoyable to drive and anyone who experiences the effortless acceleration the first time becomes an instant convert.  \\r\\nOne key difference compared to the outgoing car is that the traction control cannot be switched off manually. While in the old car, you could switch it off and leave tyre marks on the road, in the new car, the traction control gives you a perfect launch without the unnecessary wheelspin. On the move, you will not only be keeping up with traffic, but flying past other unsuspecting cars in no time (in stealth mode ) quite easily. Overall, despite the lesser torque and more power, the refreshed ZS EV feels very similar to the outgoing car in terms of performance.  \\r\\nOut on the highway, the ZS EV is fantastic. An advantage of a powerful electric motor is, if you need to perform a quick overtake, there\\'s no need to wait for a downshift or being in the engine\\'s powerband. Just bury the accelerator pedal and you\\'re off! You\\'ll hit silly speeds with ease, and not even realise it due to the lack of drama (engine noise etc.). That being said, single-gear EVs don\\'t have that higher end punch above 120 - 140 km/h that geared turbo-petrol cars do. Keep in mind that if you drive hard, the range drops drastically. This is also why you will see EVs that are driving longer distances sticking to the middle lane and cruising at 80-100 km/h (which is the best cruising speed for the current lots of EVs). We already told you that the ZS EV has a realistic range of 350 - 400 km. But with an aggressive pedal-to-the-metal driving style, GTO used up about 70% of the battery after just 135 km of hard driving. Again, EVs are best at cruising @ 80-100 km/h for long-distance travel. This sensitivity to driving style is more like turbo-petrols rather than turbo-diesels which are more forgiving.  \\r\\nGetting up to cruising speeds is an easy affair and the absence of any sound means you will reach triple-digit speeds without realising it (it\\'s only when the speed warning chimes sound that you know you\\'re doing 80 km/h and 120 km/h). The MID shows the motor spinning at 7,600 rpm while doing 100 km/h and 9,000 rpm at 120 km/h. If you\\'re wondering, \"isn\\'t this too high?\", well, most electric motors are high revving and can rev to over 20,000 rpm! This eliminates the need to use complicated gearboxes. The entire usable powerband can be achieved with a single-speed transmission, although higher-end cars like the Porsche Taycan have adopted a second gear.  \\r\\nThere are 3 driving modes to choose from and unlike some other cars, these aren\\'t gimmicky. They\\'re mapped specifically for different driving styles.  \\r\\n\\x95 Normal Mode: The default mode. The car always restarts in this mode, no matter what mode you last drove in. It\\'s great for driving in the city as well as on the highway. Strikes a good balance between power and economy.  \\r\\n\\x95 Eco Mode: The mode to engage when you want the maximum range. Throttle response is dumbed down, which actually results in a smoother drive in the city (less of that \"torque-pull\" effect). Power comes in more gradually when you ask for it. However, even in this mode, the motor does not feel dull to drive. There\\'s enough grunt for day-to-day driving and overtaking. The performance of the air-con, however, drops noticeably in this mode.  \\r\\n\\x95 Sport Mode: The mode when you really want to have fun. While Normal mode will keep you entertained 90% of the time, Sport mode is for the remaining 10%. The accelerator response is even sharper and the car just feels more eager to pounce. However, it can feel too peaky for city driving and also eats up the battery faster. Use \"Sport\" when you\\'re looking for fun on expressway runs.   Regenerative Braking  \\r\\nThere are 3 levels of regenerative braking, just like in the previous car. At levels 1 and 2, there\\'s obviously lesser resistance when you lift off the accelerator pedal. I found myself driving mostly on level 3 with maximum regeneration. Interestingly, even at level 3, the regenerative braking didn\\'t really seem as strong as in the Hyundai Kona. It\\'s slightly more subdued, but still works well and feels more natural for someone coming from a petrol / diesel-powered car. Engine braking lovers will appreciate driving with regen at the maximum level. But MG should really have made level 3 stronger.   Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) \\r\\nNo engine, no sound, no gearshifts! The ZS EV is eerily silent on the inside as well as the outside. So, you will find yourself honking at pedestrians who\\'re simply unaware of the car creeping up behind them. A faint whine from the motor is heard only at high revs, which is beyond 100 km/h and that too isn\\'t intrusive. On the highway, tyre noise and wind noise register themselves beyond 100 km/h.   Range \\r\\nMG claims a range of 461 km with the new 50.3 kWh battery pack based on ICAT certification. The new battery pack is the largest in the segment and gets ASIL-D, IP69K safety ratings, which are by today\\'s standards the highest for electric cars. It gets a UL 2580 certification, which just means that it has been tested to meet nationally-recognized safety standards. \\r\\nThe outgoing car had a 44.5 kWh battery pack and its ARAI certified range was 340 km. In all fairness, these numbers are very subjective and the real-life range solely depends on how you drive the car. Check out this excellent report by BHPian docelectric2020 where he took the ZS EV on a 1,200 km road trip. You should expect 350 - 400 km, depending on how you push the magic pedal.  \\r\\nGiven the rising demand for EVs, there are plenty of charging stations popping up everywhere, which ought to take care of range anxiety. There are many apps and websites like pulseenergy.io, plugshare.com, etc. that list out all the charging stations near you. End of the day though, remember the golden rule = EVs are best charged where they are parked (either at your office or home).   Charging \\r\\nThe ZS EV gets the industry-standard CCS type-2 charging port. You get a 7.4 kW home charger from MG installed in your parking lot that can charge the battery from 0-100% in 8.5 to 9 hours. If you\\'re travelling somewhere, you can use the portable charger in the boot to charge the car from any 15 Amp socket (the larger 3-pin sockets used for ACs and fridges), which would take about 15-19 hours to charge from 0-100%. Do note that in all EVs, the initial 0 - 80% charging happens quicker...the final 81 - 100% takes more time. The last option are the 50 kW DC fast chargers that you will find at some of the charging stations. This would fill up your car\\'s battery from 0-80% in about 60 minutes. If you\\'re still worried about getting stuck somewhere after running out of juice, MG has roadside assistance with mobile charging support currently available in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pune. \\r\\nThe charging socket is placed under a simple flap on the front solid grille. There\\'s a green indicator next to the socket showing the battery level. The pre-facelift car had a unique charging flap where the MG logo would move up and you had to insert the charging cable below. The MG logo even lit up when the car was charging (reference image). IMO, that arrangement looked way cooler than this simple open flap and charge mechanism:  \\r\\nOnce plugged in, the MID displays the remaining charging time, estimated range and battery percentage: ', 'Suspension   Ride Comfort \\r\\nEVs are inherently heavy cars due to the battery pack in the middle. Getting the right balance of ride & handling is tricky and it\\'s especially the case with EVs based on ICE cars (like the ZS EV). The ZS EV gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam suspension at the rear. It rides on 17\" alloy wheels that are shod with 215/55 section tyres. The recommended tyre pressure is a (very high) 41 PSI, presumably to maximise the driving range. With this tyre pressure, the suspension is firm and you are always aware of the kind of road you\\'re travelling on. That said, the ride quality isn\\'t as bone-jarringly stiff as the Kona. It\\'s liveable, although you will slow down for bad roads.  \\r\\nWe dropped the pressure down to 35 PSI, which made the ride more absorbent & compliant. With this more reasonable tyre pressure level, bumpy roads were handled in a better manner (although the underlying firmness was there).    Handling & Dynamics \\r\\nThe ZS EV\\'s straight-line stability is good and the car doesn\\'t feel nervous even at 120 km/h. However, if there are undulations on the road, the car does tend to feel bouncy. The handling is above average. Drive it like a family man and you\\'ll find the behaviour to be neutral. Drive it like an enthusiast and you\\'ll feel body roll, with understeer coming in earlier than expected. The ZS EV isn\\'t a car that likes being hustled through corners & these tyres can\\'t handle all that sudden torque in the turns either. We recommend a more conservative driving style on your favourite mountain roads.   Steering \\r\\nThe electric power steering is a nice unit and very user-friendly. It\\'s light at slow speeds which makes driving around the city a breeze. The EPS weighs up adequately on the highways.   Braking \\r\\nThe all-wheel disc brake setup provides good stopping power. Emergency braking situations are handled well and the car is brought to a halt from high speeds effectively.', '2022 MG ZS EV Facelift Exterior Images\\r\\nNo more Mercedes-like chrome studded grille on the ZS EV.

It looks smart and clean, although the design\\'s age does show:  \\r\\nProportionate side profile:  \\r\\nMake no mistake, this is the best \"mainstream\" electric car sold in India today:  \\r\\nThe ZS EV feels well built with uniform panel gaps. It\\'s offered in four shades - Currant Red (our test car), Ashen Silver, Sable Black and Ferris White. The nice Copenhagen Blue paint shade of the pre-facelift car has not been carried over:  \\r\\nHalogen projector headlamps have been replaced by sharper LED headlamps with integrated LED DRLs. Notice the nice crystal-like detailing on the inside:  \\r\\nWide air dam at the bottom gets a slot in the middle for ADAS tech. It\\'s a dummy for now (ZS EV doesn\\'t get ADAS):  \\r\\nSlats on the sides direct air towards wheel wells (and brakes?). Subtle chrome insert gels well with the design:  \\r\\nFull underbody protection :  \\r\\nLooks very Tesla Model 3-like in this image. Bonnet gets two prominent creases running down towards the grille:  \\r\\nORVMs get integrated turn-indicators. Side cameras for the 360-degree view are mounted below:  \\r\\nBoth front door handles get chrome request sensors. Don\\'t miss the chrome insert on the top:  \\r\\nThough the window line rises towards the rear, the glass area is adequate:  \\r\\nRedesigned 17\" alloy wheels are claimed to be more aerodynamic. They sure look the part! Shod with 215/55 section Michelin Primacy tyres (pre-facelift car had 215/50 section tyres):  \\r\\nGood to see MG offering disc brakes all-round:  \\r\\nThe panoramic sunroof will win your family over:  \\r\\nRestyled all-LED tail-lamps look sharp:  \\r\\nRedesigned rear bumper has a diffuser-like design with chrome detailing:  \\r\\nRear fog lamps and reflectors get piano black housings with honeycomb mesh grilles:  \\r\\nLike in the pre-facelift, the tailgate badge doubles up as the handle. However, it\\'s finished in the body colour now: ', '2022 MG ZS EV Facelift Interior Images\\r\\nInterior largely resembles the pre-facelift car\\'s, with a few feature additions and design changes. It looks clean and feels premium too:  \\r\\nFlat-bottom steering wheel is a delight to hold. Thumb contours are perfectly placed and design details like the perforated leather & contrast red stitching give it a sporty look. It\\'s adjustable for height, but not reach - quite sad in such an expensive model:  \\r\\nTelephony controls on the LHS and buttons for MID operation + voice assist button on the RHS:  \\r\\nOn the left, you have the light/indicator stalk and on the right is the wiper stalk. The ZS EV is equipped with auto headlamps and auto wipers. The quality of these stalks isn\\'t befitting the car\\'s hefty price tag:  \\r\\nCruise control is located below the light stalk:  \\r\\nEngine start button gets a nice chrome ring around it:  \\r\\nNew fully-digital instrument cluster has a \"power meter\" on the right. There\\'s plenty of information being displayed on the 7\" screen in the middle:  \\r\\nBattery percentage is displayed at the bottom right corner and drive modes are in the bottom left. Range is shown below the drive mode and next to it is the transmission mode. Note how much the indicated range drops in Normal and Sport modes:  \\r\\nShift to P and the MID reminds you to power \\'OFF\\' the car before leaving. You also get live animation of power flow (from the battery to motor and back) while driving. Motor speed, voltage and current are shown on the MID - something to look forward to in EVs henceforth. The ZS EV does get a tyre pressure monitoring system. See the icon with number \"3\" next to the battery %? That is the selectable regen level:   \\r\\nRound AC vents have a brushed silver border that looks nice:  \\r\\nDoorpads carry forward the all-black theme of the dashboard. They can hold 1-litre bottles and some other knick-knacks. Soft armrest feels good to use and carbon-fibre finish leather insert above the armrest feels premium:  \\r\\nVery accommodating front seats are wide and supportive. Driver\\'s seat is 6-way power-adjustable, but without lumbar adjustment. We also wish MG would\\'ve offered ventilated seats at this price point:  \\r\\nWell-spaced A and B pedals along with a very usable dead pedal:  \\r\\nSeatbelts are not adjustable for height, but they are placed at a comfortable level for most users:  \\r\\nHeated ORVMs are of a healthy size and coverage area is fair:  \\r\\nAs part of the rear driver-assist features, you have blind spot detection, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert. Whenever the system detects a car in the blind spot, the warning on the respective ORVM starts blinking. Pretty neat:  \\r\\nIRVM is decently sized. However, the headrests obstruct the view a bit:  \\r\\nAlso, just like the previous car, no auto-dimming IRVM!  \\r\\nRearward visibility from the driver\\'s seat is satisfactory, but the thick C-pillars create a blind spot. The quarter glasses do make things slightly better:  \\r\\nCentre fascia is tilted towards the driver:  \\r\\n10\" touchscreen is a very user-friendly unit. The display has a nice colour contrast with good readability, even under direct sunlight:  \\r\\nHome screen is split with various functions like the weather, AC controls, battery status and media. Other options are listed on the right for you to choose from. Various vehicle functions can be accessed through the settings menu, such as the follow-me-home headlamps function, hill descent control, pedestrian alert and rear-drive assist functions. AC controls can be operated via the touchscreen as well (nice graphics!). The display for the 360-degree camera is very poor. You can switch between a 2D view and 3D view of the car for better judgement of a curb or other obstacles:  \\r\\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity has been provided, albeit not wireless. Pressing the battery button (on the centre console above the transmission mode selector) brings up the screen showing the range and other battery information. You can scroll to see how much carbon dioxide you have saved! Also find the nearest charging station with the onboard navigation:  \\r\\nJust below the touchscreen are the controls for the climate control system. Interestingly, the buttons for adjusting the volume of the sound system & accessing the home screen have been placed here too. Good from the usability POV:  \\r\\nAt the base of the centre fascia, there\\'s a wireless charging pad along with a 12V socket and Type-C / Type-A USB ports:  \\r\\nCentre console gets a grab handle for the front passenger. Those experiencing an EV\\'s instant torque the first time might find it handy:  \\r\\nClassy gear mode selector has been carried over from the previous car. Pressing the round knob engages \\'P\\'. There are three switches on the top for the drive mode selection, regenerative braking level and battery status:  \\r\\nBelow, you have the electronic parking brake and auto-hold switch with black faux wood around them. Two cupholders have been provided:  \\r\\nThey get a sliding cover:   \\r\\nBeneath the centre armrest is a useable storage compartment, although its floor area is narrow:  \\r\\nA closer look at the carbon-fibre finish leather insert on the dashboard with the contrast red stitching. Very sporty!  \\r\\nThe glovebox is just about average in size. It does not get cooling or illumination:  \\r\\nNew sunroof control panel. The earlier one had a round knob for the operation of the sunroof & sunshade:  \\r\\nLarge panoramic sunroof allows plenty of light inside the cabin to make it feel bright and airy:  \\r\\nRear doorpads have an identical theme to the front ones. They can carry 1-litre bottles along with some other stuff:  \\r\\nGetting in and out of the rear seat is an easy affair. The seats are set at the perfect height for you to easily slide into them. Once in, there\\'s a decent amount of knee room and headroom for someone of my height (5\\'10\"):  \\r\\nBehind my own driving position, I had enough knee room to be comfortable. With the front seat pushed back, my knees touch the seatback:  \\r\\nThree 3-point seatbelts as well as three adjustable headrests have been provided, but the rear seat is better suited for 2 adults and a kid (rather than 3 healthy adults). If it is two overweight adults, even a kid cannot be accommodated. Also, the middle portion of the backrest protrudes (due to the armrest) and the seat base is elevated in the centre:  \\r\\nCentre armrest is soft and wide enough for both rear passengers to rest their arms on. It gets two cupholders:  \\r\\nAC vents for rear passengers. Type-A and Type-C USB charging ports are located just below. A piano black insert around these would\\'ve looked nice:  \\r\\nBig parcel tray gets a prominent border to keep items placed on it from rolling onto the rear seat:  \\r\\nThanks to BHPian Arnav612 for sharing this information. The size of the boot has decreased as the spare wheel is now a full-size piece (the outgoing car came with a space saver). Still, the space available is adequate to carry a family\\'s weekend luggage. Folding the rear seat down gives you more cargo capacity:  \\r\\nSpare is now a full-size steel wheel, a most welcome move as space-savers come with 80 kmph speed restrictions. Tyre changing kit and tow hook are arranged nicely in a Styrofoam casing: ', 'We have some really good EVs on sale in India now with the Tigor, Nexon & ZS electrics, but it\\'s the MG that\\'s the best relatively affordable one. China went all out on EVs & SAIC (MG\\'s parent) has been building thousands of them for a while now...that experience shows in just how \"sorted\" the ZS EV feels.

I have not installed the 7KW charger and have been happily making do with the slow charger that plugs into any 15A plug. If you plug it in at night, say around 9pm, you would get around 60% to 70 charge done by the morning. Normally one does not charge from zero and should charge till about 80% for battery health. Hence if you plug it in at 20 to 30% charge remaining, you will be at 80% by the morning even with the slow charger. Unless you need to drive 300  kms daily and don\\'t have the time to charge overnight, the faster 7KW charger is not needed. You can contact me after you receive the ZS and I can help you sell the 7KW charger if you want to do so.

I have been charging my ZS using the slow charger without any issues. Normally I put it to charge at around 25 to 30%. I charge to 80% for battery health.  So I need around 10 hours on the slow charger. Plugging in at night, you can easily get 12 hours of charge by the morning which is equivalent to a 60% top up. Unless you are going on a long trip and need a 100% charge, this works really well. When I have a long trip coming up, I simply plug in at around 5pm and I am ready to go by the morning. You can also stop by a fast charger for 30 minutes once in while if there is some urgency but I have never needed to do this.  \\nYou can easily sell your MG provided 7KW charger on various forums.

Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by GTO   Thank you for putting up your first-hand experience . It\\'s what I have been saying from the start. 95% of car owners do NOT need anything more than the regular 15A plug. Reasons: \\n- Your car is anyway parked overnight for 8 - 12 hours. That is more than enough to charge your battery to a level that will exceed your daily commuting requirements. Heck, in most cases, a 10 hour charge on a 15A plug will give you enough juice for 4 - 5 days.  \\n- No one will wait till 0% to charge an EV. Assuming you plug it in at 30%, you will easily be at 80% (or more) by the morning.  \\n- Even with a 15A plug, the typical commuter won\\'t need to charge more than once or twice a week.  \\n- Plugging in isn\\'t a hassle at all. In fact, its more convenient than going to the petrol pump. My cars are on trickle chargers and it\\'s way more effort to plug the trickle chargers in than an EV. I have to remove the Bosch C7 from the boot, open the bonnet, place the Bosch C7 carefully, connect the positive & negative terminals, then route the power cord through a gap, plug it into a wall, power up and close the bonnet. Sometimes, I have to manually choose the mode too (AGM vs regular 12v). Repeat exercise in reverse when I have to drive away, and repeat in the same order when I return. In comparison, the ZS EV I had recently was a breeze to plug in.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe perfect city car:  \\nOn the open road, that instant torque means you can keep up with far more expensive machinery. EVs will democratize performance. You could never get a 0-100 7 to 8 second petrol car under 12 lakhs before, but you will with EVs. Watch this space:  \\nPeople driving a ZS EV for the first time become instant converts. My brother-in-law now wants to buy an EV next...  \\n...as do my bhabhi & nephew.

However, for majority of EV buyers, it would be their second or third car, and this is when the high price tag of the ZS plays spoilsport. In this scenario, the Nexon EV (despite all its quirks and QC issues) appears as a much more viable option for Indian middle class car buyers.

The cost of buying a fast EV charger is just around 60k to 70k today. Compare this with how much it costs to set up a petrol station which easily runs into crores. Even with low utilization, EV chargers can easily break even. This is the reason why you see a massive increase in the number of chargers in India. Just open Plugshare and Tata Power to see the number of chargers. Given that setting up EV chargers has been delicensed, I expect that within the next 24 months, all major highways to be electrified because most restaurants will gain high-value captive customers. This is already true in most parts of TN because of Zeon. \\r\\nAccording to British Petroleum, their EV chargers are about to overtake their fuel pumps in profitability: Link   \\r\\n2. Batteries even after a decade of use, contain a lot of rare earth which are very valuable. So it makes it extremely lucrative to recycle them.

There is no way people will dump such valuable batteries when so much money can be made out of them.Link \\r\\n3. For EVs there is not much in terms of maintainence.

Personally, for me, I would need a few breaks on a 500 plus km journey and charging won\\x92t be an issue.\\r\\nBattery swapping is not a workable idea at all. Would you be ok with swapping your 12 plus lakh battery that is at a 100% SOH (state of health) with an unknown one which might have 20% degradation? What if your battery is only a few months old but the swapped one is 5 years old? This only works with fleets like taxis which run in a small pre determined area. In addition, setting up a charger is easy and cheap. Any hotel, restaurant, rest area or business can easily do so. So you would have thousands of options. If you were limited to swapping, there would be very few stations in some limited areas. Then there are all kinds of problems that would crop up. Imagine a power failure in the middle of the swapping process or some other complication. Would there be trained mechanics available 24/7 to handle this? The area required, the equipment and the cost is far more than a simple charger. Now with chargers available at rates as high as 350KW, you can charge a vehicle in 10 minutes. So swapping is a complete non starter. Some companies might try it by selling a cheaper vehicle with battery as a service concept where you won\\x92t own or pay for the battery. It might work in commercial vehicles and some basic budget EVs. It won\\x92t work for normal personal use. A taxi driver doesn\\x92t want to spend an hour out of this 10 hour shift on charging each day.

So instead of repeating all the hits and misses, I have focused on my initial ownership experience and observations. I got this car in April and I am enjoying it so far.  I was instantly attracted on the first ride. Her sophistication, elegance and energy had me smitten. I had to woo her a lot because there were so many suitors. She tested my patience but finally after several months she moved in with me. Now I have gotten to know her personality better and the initial attraction has metamorphosed into deep admiration.   The first few weeks revealed her quirks. I quickly found out that she hates heat. Her efficiency drops rapidly and so I try to keep her in the shade. She also doesn't like to be pushed to the limit and prefers smooth sailing. She has a weird accent and so we keep our verbal dialogue to a minimum. After several efforts I was also able to convince her not to start the radio every morning.   She is like an exotic beauty and yet extremely low maintenance. Her best aspect is the poise with which she carries herself even while hustling. There is no melodrama instead just peace and comfort. At the start I thought she was strictly a city gal but it seems she doesn't mind a short weekend getaway. She was surprisingly fun and energetic on our recent trip. We both know that she is a sprinter and not a marathoner. So she doesn't mind me occasionally riding with other gals who prefer cross country trips. She knows I will come back to her. She is also very charismatic and has charmed my family and friends. She is unique and the easiest to live with compared to all my previous partners. \\nThese are still early days but so far I love this car for its refinement, comfort, acceleration and technology. \\n  Following are the things I have done and recommend to prospective owners:If possible install the 7kW      charger because it has all the advantages of slow charging at thrice the      speed. When you are back late in night and need to head out early the next      day you will appreciate the charging speed. Set the regeneration to      highest and push through the change. I felt motion sick for the first few      days because my body was expecting coasting instead of deceleration. But      now I love not having to use the brakes so much so that I long for      stronger regeneration. I got a ventilated seat      cover powered by a 12V socket. This not only prevents sweaty backsides but      also increases range because the AC doesn\\x92t have to work very hard. I bought a dongle to convert      wired android auto to wireless According to my research this car most likely has a LFP battery (not confirmed officially) that is actively cooled. This chemistry is very      resilient to high charging/discharging so don\\x92t fret about charging to      100% or going down to 20%. On the contrary it needs to charge to full to      get a good estimate of SOC (state of charge). Do your own research before      buying the car and if you are still risk averse to this new technology      stay clear of EVs. But after you have pulled the trigger enjoy the car      without worrying about battery degradation. Personally this car fit my      requirements so well compared to anything else on the market that I am      okay to be an early adopter (probably early majority) of this relatively      new technology. I believe that the car will remain usable in the city for      a very long time. Other things of interest that I have noticed:As I mentioned before this      car isn\\x92t efficient in heat. If the car is parked in direct sun than in      44° afternoons I notice the efficiency drop to 4.5-5km/KWH and it      increases to 6.5-7km/KWH in 35° evenings. On a relaxed night drives I see      the efficiency rise above 8km/KWH. I am not a sedate driver and I      consistently got an effective range of around 300-320kms in the hottest      month of the year with ambient temperatures soaring above 42°. All of these      observations are with the car in the Normal drive mode and the regeneration      set to the highest (the car defaults to these settings on every start). The regeneration      unfortunately goes away and the efficiency is the least when SOC is above      95%. Eco mode lightens the      steering, dampens the throttle response and the AC to give about 10-15%      boost in efficiency. Full power is still available with heavier throttle      when needed. I would probably use this mode in cooler monsoons and      winters. Compared to a hatch or a      sedan the ride is firmer at low speeds. One can carry more speed over bad      roads and it actually improves the ride. I like the heft of the      steering which is unlike other light modern steering wheels. Also many      controls feel similar to past VAG cars I have come to appreciate      all the technology which I initially didn\\x92t care much about. The image      quality from the 360 camera should have been better. Even so with dynamic      guidelines it surely eases getting in and out of my tight parking spot at      work or on a tight ramp. The blind spot detection light in the ORVMs is a      great touch. The alerts are overcautious so I look over my shoulder only      when the light isn\\x92t blinking. The rear cross traffic alert is very      helpful when backing out of certain parking zones. The glass roof is a hit with      rear passengers and the rear AC vents keeps everyone cool Purchase decision\\n This thankfully ended my passionate and painful car search journey of 2 years. This car replaces my 10 year old Polo for my daily city commutes of about 40 odd kilometres. I tried all the turbo petrol automatic crossovers from the Duster to the Compass and all had some deal breakers. Most suffered from the turbo lag and felt slow to respond to my throttle inputs when I wanted sudden bursts of acceleration at low speeds. I was finally convinced with the Octavia even though it\\x92s a bit too big for my needs. I have seen enough Skoda breakdowns in my family past 60000 kilometres to not trust the brand with high mileage use cases. But the Octavia seemed like the only car that would make me happy and so I had prepared myself to pamper the car including its DSG gearbox, light suede seats and the turbo petrol engine. I also braced myself for the high running and maintenance costs. While waiting for discounts on the Octavia, I test drove the ZS EV and found it impressive. I never thought I would get an EV in 2022 much less so with a relatively new brand. The exclusive (top) trim surely seems expensive by 2-3 lakhs but then so is everything else that I liked in these times of supply shortages. The MG sales and service experience have been very good so far. They have cordially attended to my several unusual requests pre and post sales. \\nAmong all the cars that I test drove I felt that under 30 lakhs the Compass is a solid touring car, the Octavia is an elegant all-rounder and the ZS EV is a brilliant city car. If one needs a silent, comfortable and a quick automatic city car this one should be on the shortlist. \\n I have been lucky in terms of ownership experiences with all my past cars and I anticipate this one will build special memories too.\", '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by NT56   I corroborate with all the things mentioned in the official review.

A lithium battery can give out lot of amps, even at low SOC. As long as it doesn't trigger the low voltage cut off or some other limp mode threshold voltage, the air conditioner should run fine with or without charging. \\nAnother example, let's say you are gaming in your phone, If you slow charge with a regular usb 2.0 port. The battery level may stay the same because all the power from the USB 2.0 port 2.5w max is being used by the phone cpu/gpu.

My booking was done on 7th Feb 2022 in MG Noida. \\r\\nHere are my first impressions:The drive experience is simply amazing. Apart from the high acceleration and silence that you would expect from an EV, the handling and suspension is also quite good. Normal seems to be the best mode to drive in. The AC performance takes a huge dip on switching to Eco, and Sport drains battery like anything. So Normal Mode seems best, at least in the scorching heat of Delhi. KERS Level 3 takes a lot of time to get used to. The deceleration on leaving the accelerator pedal is too high to be not noticed.

They didn\\x92t even put a back button in the entire UI. Under thigh support is lacking in the rear seat. I expected it to be better. The front seats, on the other hand, are too comfortable. The quality of leatherite in the interior is really good and gives a complete luxurious feel. The Sunshade is very thin, and there is significant sunlight coming in even on closing the shade. But I doubt they could have done much here considering that the shade has to not just go back and rather crumble in a roll due to the length of the shade. All in all, the pan atomic sunroof enhances the driving experience significantly. I found it a little weird that the data of KMs run, etc. can be reset whenever you want. You can reset both trip and overall data, which seems odd to me. The most absurd design flaw in the car is that you cannot raise the wipers. I tried doing this and it stuck in the edge of the bonnet, scraping some paint as well. You have to go through a lengthy procedure of putting the wipers in service mode to be able to raise them. The entire charade is blantaly senseless and unnecessary.  \\r\\nWill post more about my impressions of the car in my coming days. \\r\\nThe car doesn\\x92t start charging until you lock it.

I would like to tell this especially to those of you who would be driving an EV for the first time.  The range changes drastically based on your driving style. \\nIn the first leg of my journey, I drove for 203 km with 64% battery, which extrapolates to 317 km of range. During this trip, there was heavy traffic ok the highway and I could hardly go above 90 kmph. Mostly the car drove between 60-80 kmph.  \\nIn the second leg, I drove 210 km with 82% battery, which extrapolates to 256 km of range. This time the road was fairly empty and the car drove consistently in 80-100 kmph range, touching 120 kmph at times. The temperatures also increased, so I think the AC also sucked up more energy.  \\nI was driving in Normal mode and KERS 3 in both scenarios.  \\nSo I would recommend you to plan your trips with stoppages no later than ~200 km if you want peace of mind. And don't worry about wasting a lot of time. The charging is very quick till 80% SOC. You can easily charge 0-80% in 35-40 mins on 50 kW charger. The last 20% takes a lot of time, which you can avoid, if you plan stops properly.  \\nAnd if you really have to plan long legs in the journey, be really soft on pedal, avoid aggresive overtakes, stick to 60-80 kmph, and switch to Eco mode if weather permits. The only reason I could not stick to Eco was that the AC practically becomes useless in the current weather of North India.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by siddharthgarg   So I took a long road trip using my ZS EV.  \\r\\nSo I would recommend you to plan your trips with stoppages no later than ~200 km if you want peace of mind.

So this definitely was not the network range issue. Since these were not some \"must work\" features for me, I thought I will visit the workshop later. After 7 days, these features suddenly started working on their own only to stop working again after a week or so. I also noticed one more issue that when I started my car, the SoC showed 14% on head unit whereas actual range was around 71% (which was displayed correctly in Instrument Cluster). This corrects itself after driving a few kms. The same issue was observed 3-4 times where the SoC will always show 14%. This time I took my car to workshop and the SA told me that couple of owners have reported the 14% SoC issue for 2022 model. They also checked the connected features issue and came to a conclusion that the T-box is going in sleep mode. They did system reset and the issue was resolved. SA spoke to technical folks from plant or head office and said that it\\'s a bug in the 2022 model software and will require a month to fix. Until then these issues may reoccur.

During morning, there is hardly any traffic and can drive peacefully without much hard stops and accelerations. Evening drive is mostly traffic jams and lot of signals. I am charging the vehicle once in a week (mostly on Friday), after driving around 300-320 kms and still with 10 % SOC remaining. So thermionically consistently getting around 350kms of range.

For some reason the mileage seemed to fluctuate based on the driving skills and usage. Since, it was brand new, based on my driving and other criteria, it indicated a very low mileage and I overreacted and posted very negatively about the car and my sincere apologies for the same.

Tata motors has all kinds of reasons. they claim 417 km mileage they claim if one drives at 30km speed. why will i need a car if it i have to drive at 30km speed, i might as well walk! didn't expect this from the Tata's at all. just like any other company they are just there to make fools out of retail customers. please do not buy this car. it's full of false promises and deceit.\", 'Had a wonderful buying experience as rto is not applicable so it saves pretty good amount, driving experience is the next benchmark for any car.

Nexon got 5* safety rating in the crash test earlier.  \\n2) Its fun to drive. There is no lag & the car pulls cleanly. Be a bit careless, wheel spins like crazy!  \\n3) The suspension is well tuned. The car is comfortable over rough patches, as well as the handling is equally good. Body roll is well sorted. I found it less bumpier than the Diesel Nexon.   \\n4) The music system will please the majority of the buyers.  \\n5) Compared to it's competitors, starting at Rs 13.99L makes this car the most value for money.  \\n6) Interiors are good and felt nicely put-together.  \\n7) Decently feature loaded.  \\n8) 205 mm ground clearance can tackle the bad roads with aplomb.  \\n9) Low running cost of an EV. \\n10) The color choices have been tastefully chosen.

Will drop even further if driven aggressively.  \\n2) Could find few small panel gaps or rough edges.  \\n3) Ergonomics could have been better. Eg the placement of the 12v socket or the driver side hand-rest and few more.  \\n4) Tyre noise and the whine of the electric motor is audible. Unless I drive the Hyundai Kona or the Mg ZS, I will reserve my opinion on the overall NVH level.  \\n5) Electronic cutoff to avoid wheel-spin should have been provided.  \\n6) Upgrading to a better tyre is recommended. The stock tyres lose grip much earlier than the chassis gives up.  \\n7) White door pads, or white leather seats in the top trim will require regular attention to keep them clean.  \\n8) Long term reliability is unknown for this car.  \\n9) Auto up/down on the drivers side power window is missing.  \\n10) The high floor-pan in rear hinders the comfort of the passenger seating in the middle.    Prelude-  \\nMr. Rik Chatterjee (Product specialist for Nexon Ev east) & Mr. Sourav Chatterjee (Territory sales manager) from Tata invited Bhpian arindam_xeta to test drive the Nexon EV and give some feedback on the car. Me being a very close friend of Bhpian arindam_xeta, I was also invited for the same.  \\nWe were with the car for more than 4 hours and drove quite a good distance within the city, as well as on open roads too.    Few facts about the car \\nThis car comes with a 30.2 kWh battery which claims to give a range of 317 km. In real condition while driving in 'D' mode the range is around 250 km and in 'S' mode it's around 190-200 km. The battery can be charged to 80% in just 60 minutes with a fast DC charger, whereas it will take more than 8 hours from a household socket.  \\nThe Nexon EV is 150-200 kg heavier than the Nexon Diesel. But this car comes with a single gear with 245 NM of instant torque and 129 ps of power. This ensures it to be quite a fun car.  \\nThe costlier MG ZS EV or the Hyundai Kona costs 20-24L on road whereas this car starts from around Rs 15L on road. The MG ZS or the Kona will enjoy a range of 100+ km more, but nothing can beat the Nexon in the value for money factor.  A small comparison between the three-    My take on the car-     \\nThis car comes in 3 variants- XM, XZ+, XZ+LUX \\nOur test drive car was the XZ+ \\nA smart watch to greet us.   \\nThis color looks stunning. My wife loved this color too. There is nothing new to write on the exterior design of the Nexon.      \\nA full Led setup would have looked more premium!    The Interior \\nAm not the right person to comment on the interiors, but I kind of felt it to be nice.  \\nThe seats are quite comfortable and supportive. The leg-space in rear and front is decent.  \\nThe A/C was a chiller. \\nThe music system should satisfy the need of the majority.  \\nThe ergonomics was more or less okay, leaving one or two sore spots. Like the position of the 12v socket or the drivers hand-rest were not quite comfortable to use. Would have preferred the hand rest in a bit more forward and a bit upward position for the driver to rest his left arm.  \\nThe top variant comes with white leather seats.       \\nIn the long run it will be tough to keep the door pads clean.    \\n350 L of boot space. The charging cable is kept inside the boot.    \\nThe flat bottom steering was nice to hold.   \\nInstrument cluster looks good with all the essential info's on display.      The Drive-  \\nThe real world range is around 250 km in 'D' mode but if driven spiritedly in 'S' mode it drastically comes down to below 190 km. Will drop even further if driven aggressively. \\nBy aggressively driving for 20 km, the range came down to 195 km from 232 km in sports mode. The battery showed 78% from 93%. So on aggressive driving for 20 km the dip was 15% with regards to charge and 38 km in range. The range makes the Nexon EV, strictly a city car.  \\nWith light foot driving in Drive mode the drop in charge and range was in acceptable range.  \\nThe driver can chose the driving mode through this knob. The brake pedal must be pressed to change the mode by using this rotary knob. Once the mode is set, releasing the brake pedal starts the vehicle to crawl without any accelerator input.    \\nA comfortable foot-well with a dead pedal.    \\n129 PS engine with 245 NM instant torque with a single speed gear ensured there is no lag and the car pulls cleanly right from the word go. Tata claims a 0-100 timing of 9.9 second, I have not tested that, but the way this car pulls, I wont be surprised if it can hit 100 km/hr even below that! The D mode is more that adequate in city but the S mode is real fun. A bit of over acceleration and the tyre screeches like crazy. Electronic cutoff to avoid wheel-spin should have been provided at-least with a turn on/off option.  \\nWhile starting from a signal it's easy to keep the traffic behind without working much on the accelerator. In one word, this car is fun to drive. It's fast. The top-speed was electronically limited to 120 km/hr, so couldn't test it beyond that on open roads.  \\nIt pulls cleanly all throughout with an even acceleration. Its not like a weak low-end or strong mid-range, the pull is even throughout the range.  \\nTyre noise and the whine of the electric motor is audible under acceleration, unless I drive the Hyundai Kona or the Mg ZS, I will reserve my opinion on the overall NVH level. Though I must say the vibration and harshness is not there, they are well sorted.  \\nThe engine bay looks neat.   \\nOn a twisty flyover within the city, I maintained the line and pushed the car a bit, the tyres screeched crazily. The tyres gave up much before the chassis gives up. Upgrading the tyres are recommended.  \\nEven these 215/60/R16 are not enough to handle the instant torque of this car. A better set of rubbers can do wonders. Torque-steer was felt under hard acceleration, but then again its a FWD car. A better set of rubbers will take care of that to some extent.    \\nThe suspension is quite well tuned. The ride is not bumpy, its quite comfortable on bad roads, plus this car can be pushed through the corners confidently. I loved throwing this car around the corners. The body-roll is well sorted. Tata has got the set-up just right. Bhpian arindam_xeta commented this car to be much more comfortable on bad roads than his Nexon diesel.  \\nThe steering weighs up in sports mode and gives adequate feedback in respect to EPS standard.  \\nThe braking feels progressive and confidence inspiring. The pedal feel is good, it's not spongy or soft. The front got Disc and the rear got drum brakes. All four discs would have been even better.  \\nThe battery pack is placed in the middle of the floor, and it's a heavy unit. Still Tata managed to give a ground clearance of 205 mm. \\nBut the high floor-pan in rear hinders the comfort of the passenger seating in the middle.   \\nThe underbelly looks neat and there are no unwanted protrusions which can get damaged on an underbelly hit. The underbelly looks well protected. \\nThe ground-clearance and the approach angle are more than adequate for a car whose majority of the life will be spent in city driving.       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plKZCuynmwE            My verdict-  \\n1) It does make sense for people who are looking to buy an automatic city car with a budget of around Rs 15-16L.  \\n2) The sub 4 meter length will ensure ease of parking, whereas the EV will ensure cheaper running cost. Tata claims the running cost to be Rs 1 per km.  \\n3) The long term reliability of this car is unknown to us, but the 8 years or 160,000 km warranty on the battery & motor with 3 Year or 1,25,000 km vehicle warranty should ensure some peace of mind. Plus the resale value of EV's in Indian is still unknown to us.  \\n4) It's a fun to drive car. Weekend morning breakfast meets can be fun in this car! It can actually keep-up with a Polo GT TSI or an Abarth Punto in 0-100 sprints. The single gear ensures there is no lag either. \\nDo make sure, if it's a spirited drive, it should be in a range of 100-150 km, not more than that. Else while returning back home, the anxiety of getting stranded by exhausting the battery will creep in!  \\n5) Overall this is the best TATA car i drove till date. My favorites were the Nexon diesel and the Hexa AWD, but this EV exceeded my expectation. (I never drove the JTP's, so this statement may not stand 100% correct.)\", 'Can you please tell us for how many km did you drive the vehicle?

With that full charge and with a conservative city range of 250 km, it is a fraction of what it will cost per km to run the same car on petrol or diesel. Twenty litres of diesel - on the other hand - will cost Rs 1500+.  \\nPlus, you don't need to replace engine oil, air filters, oil filters etc. However, I think electric cars do need some sort of coolant though (?).  \\nMaybe not for enthusiasts or for those whose daily running is quite high, but I certainly can see the advantages of an electric car. Even taking into account a sort of buffer, 250 km is enough to cater to 4-5 days of running. But one does not even need to think that much, just charge put it on charge every night and be greeted with a full tank everyday. No need to worry about fuel pump visits! \\nCONS: Will require atleast a dedicated parking space in a secure location if not an enclosed garage.

Nexon got 5* safety rating in the crash test earlier.  \\n 2) Its fun to drive. There is no lag & the car pulls cleanly. Be a bit careless, wheel spins like crazy!    \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's another pro, we don't have to use the brakes as often as we do in the regular ICE cars for slowing down, that's really cool and also almost doubles the life of brakes. Also when I drove it, felt the regen to be not so aggressive, heard somewhere that regen actually adjusts itself automatically according the state-of-charge(SOC) in the battery.

The MG ZS or the Kona will  enjoy a range of 100+ km more, but nothing can beat the Nexon in the  value for money factor.  A small comparison between the three-  Attachment 2022576    \\r\\n\\r\\nSmall correction, neither eZS nor Kona start at onroad 20L, eZS comes for around ~22L and Kona for ~25L if we add 1 lakh to the ex-showroom price.

That version will be priced  below 20L on road. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nWow, that bridges the range gap between Nexon EV and Kona/eZS, we can expect a real world range of 350KM which is on-par or better than its competitors. This makes it an even more compelling package. \\nOverall, Nexon EV fits perfectly for those who already had an ICE car and are looking for another one for in-city use with some 150~200KM occasional drives. Presently, there is no other practical EV at this price range.\", 'I got to drive the Kona EV (almost 50 Kms) and the Nexon EV (10 Kms), and I realised that in order to get a decent range from an electric vehicle we need to change our driving style. Driving with foresight and avoiding unnecessary bursts of acceleration when you see there is a speed breaker or a signal ahead and understanding how to use the regenerative braking in our favor will be very helpful to increase the range. (Regen on the nexon feels strong as there were no options to increase or decrease it) \\r\\nIn my opinion a real world driving range of 200-250 Km should be sufficient for driving inside the city without worrying about getting stranded on the road', 'Makes tremendous sense as a second city run about car. Also there are specific use cases for a few businessmen who may be required to commute 150 kms in a day  where this car will pay for the investment difference in fuel saved in a short time frame.

Thank you Samba. Enjoyed reading it. Car seems to be super fun to drive. This can be a good weekday car to anyone with a 40 km/day work week. 250/5 = 50 rupees per day is a lot cheaper than any public transport. \\nThe affordable entry price point along with practicality will encourage a lot of early adopters to make the shift towards EVs. \\nAlso, the biggest apprehension against TATA, the after sales service, shouldn't be a concern considering this car does not require many constant routine maintenance things.\", 'First of all congrats. You managed to test drive a car during this pandemic. \\nThe Cons have been carried forward from the ICE models I guess IMHO given the stats, it should be a successful product within few years.

You have previously driven the ICE version. So is it just like the ECO mode from the ICE or a mix of ECO and CITY. As you said for changing the mode you need to press the brake pedal, is there any speed limit for this?  \\nLoved your review.

But if we compare it that way, we may have to bring into picture the running costs per KM. Nexon EV at spirited driving may cost around Rs.1.2 per KM. Polo TSI at spirited driving may cost Rs.10 per KM.  \\r\\nThanks you Samba for a detailed review. This car really deserves success. It is full 9-10 lakhs cheaper than the other two EVs and has much better ground clearance than the duo.  \\r\\nThere are many even in big cities whose daily driving is 20-30 Kms a day. Such folks will be needing to charge this only once a week, even with spirited drives and stop and go crawl. Those commuting 150 Kms one way can also buy this car, provided they spend 4-5 hours at the other end. This would be enough to top up the half-gone range and be ready for a comfortable return trip.

Electric cars are the future but they are not there yet. But this comes as close as anyone has till now. I think it will take around 60-70k km to make up for the price difference purely on initial cost and fuel rate difference (I considered a nexon petrol amt for reference).

Pulled the car to the side, waited a few mins and then restarted. It worked fine for a few days and then suddenly the same thing happened multiple times at a signal. My friends in the car had to push and it was embarrassing. Anyway used the same logic of turning it off and cooling it down for a few seconds. After a few attempts, it worked fine but I escalated the issue to the specialists and they arranged me a technician within 30 minutes and he cleared some errors. Since then, I haven't noticed that issue again but it was most definitely software related.  \\r\\nAnyway, as I said before, besides these instances the car has been perfect.

Before booking, I had taken a couple of test drives. I felt that this car met most of my requirements, so I went ahead with the booking. I was told that the waiting period was 6-8 weeks. Since I was not in a hurry, I was fine with the waiting period. \\r\\nWith the lockdown enforced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, I was working from home. Hence, the need for a car was not immediate. But to have a personnel car going forward became a must. So I kept following up with KHT to understand the time frame by which I can expect the car to be allotted. I also insisted on personally checking the car before it is allotted. \\r\\nOn 25th June, I visited the stockyard of KHT motors to check the car. I also noted down the chassis number for my reference. I made the payment via cheque on the same day. On returning home, I cross-checked the chassis number to find out the manufacturing month of the car. It turned out to be manufactured in February 2020. It was a small surprise as the sales guy had told me that it was a May 2020 manufactured vehicle. On questioning, the sales guy confirmed that it was indeed made in February 2020.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t   \\r\\n\\r\\nInvoice:  \\r\\nWhatsApp conversation:    Quote:   \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI couldn't resist myself and shared this experience with Tata Motors' customer care.

It came out to be 30m. Since the first 15m is free as part of the installation, I made the payment for the remaining 15m. On the day of the installation, the society executive members requested for some change in the way the cable should be laid. I think they wanted the cable to be slightly away from the rainwater harvesting ducts. Now, the installation guys wanted to re-measure the length. It came out to be 37m. They stopped the installation. They asked me to first pay for the extra 7m and only then they would do the installation. I paid for the 7m cable length (Rate of cable: Rs. 250 + GST per meter). Next day, they arrived and did the installation. I kept a sharp watch on the length of the cable used. I can confirm that the actual cable length used was NOT more than 32m. But they ended up billing me for 37m and hence there was no refund.

To check whether the car was charging or not is something that didn't cross my mind when the showroom guys were present.

Waiting is a good choice of inter city is needed because few chargers can change the whole situation.    \\r\\n\\r\\nActually i am waiting for higher battery capacity and range because even if the chargers are available in the future, i am not comfortable stopping for more than 1 hour (including the potential queues for the charger) every 150-200 km on the highway. I tend to take large breaks after every 250-300 km during longer drives. Also, most of the big cities around pune (except Mumbai) are at 220-260 km from Pune which take around 3-4 hours to travel and people normally tend to do that without a large break, so it will be convenient and hence practical to have that much range with additional 10-20% buffer charge. This way we can reach either our destinations without a forced charging break or at least upto a distance where we will willingly prefer a larger break while our cars also get charged.', 'Test Drove the Nexon EV Lux+ variant last week.

I have owned the car for more than 2 months now. I am also part of a Nexon EV owners group where in we discuss the car with passion and try to address issues and concerns as well. Here are my thoughts about the car. \\nPros :\\n1. The car is a fantastic product. I think Tata\\'s effort in putting a good product together needs to be lauded. \\n2. The car is super silent and awesome to drive.\\n3. Handling is top notch, being a SUV , it can ride on any surface. \\n4. Overall fit and finish is ok except for some gaps on the outside. \\n5. Overall a good \"City\" car if your commute is not too much and you are living in a big city and mostly travel alone.  \\nCons : \\nI think this section needs to be read carefully by all potential buyers or people with keen interest in the product.   The ARAI range may be 312km per charge but everyone needs to note that it is under standard testing conditions which are almost impractical to replicate. So \"DO NOT\" believe the shows sales guys if they tell you that range is 312km.  The claimed range of 250km is also not true. The actual usable range is no where near this figure so far. There are reasons for this. The best efficiency the car can achieve right now is 119 wh/km. With a 30.2 kw battery and 119 wh/km , max 252 km can be achieved. This is with the fact that all 30.2kw is available for use. EVs have a reserve battery range and so 100% allocation is not possible. Atleast, the existing owners of the EV have not seen 100% available. This is inspite of the fact that tata is advertising 100 wh/km efficiency on the site. The SOC (State of charge) and DTE ( Distance to Empty ) readings on the car are not reliable and very unpredictable. The trip details are also not correct and so the wh/km you see is never accurate.  Around 180 to 220 is the maximum you can extract from the car but you need to drive very sedately for this. Max speed around 50-70 . Also, at times you can only extract that range if you do not use the AC.  The AC has some issues with the current cars, even at 26 deg , it chills like 20 deg. So that adds to extra power overheads. The car has been launched with very limited charging infrastructure available right now. The limited range and limited charging infras, make it a \"city only\" car and mostly can be driven just nearby. Some people have been getting only 160km range. Tata representatives say that driving style modifications need to be done to achieve the range, however for most buyers during the pre-sales process this is never explained. The sales guys blatantly claim 250km atleast as the range and some even say more than 312 which is just not right. The remote connectivity features advertised with the car are buggy. Their app almost never works. It is very very slow even when it works seldomly. The software on the car, the battery management system is still not perfect. There have been instances when cars have been stuck at remote places and even have had issues during charging where cars just won\\'t charge or the charge went to 0 out of nowhere. The aux battery went dead on many cars out of nowhere and some cars needed to be flatbedded to the dealerships.    Most important part is about the Tata\\'s approach to the early adopters of their product. The early adopters have been trying to communicate all issues we have faced so far with Tata but there has been no proper feedback from them.  \\nTata has a good product in its hand but it needs to solve the practical issues about the car\\'s usability and software before this can become a good buy for customers.', \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by WhiteSierra   Please don't take any offense, my bad.

Even if it comes, it is not possible to do it in the current nexon's chassis. With the current range of around 200 km, the battery pack needs to be almost 2.5 times more for 500km.

They work hard and enter a segment with not a perfect product. Through WOM, trust factor goes for a toss, and they will not have anything substantial in the segment they ventured in first. Citing the opportunities in that segment, other manufacturers would enter the segment with a decent product and capture the market share. The best example is TATA Indigo - Market captured by Dzire. \\r\\nExisting owners, my intention is not to hurt any here. Wish TATA enters a segment bang on, so there is no turning back ', \"Sad to read about your experience. 200 km should be the minimum range for EVs in India- many people commute over 100 km to and from the office.  \\nThe mention of battery issues is disconcerting. Hope these things get resolved through warranty replacements.  \\nI fail to understand why ARAI continues to support fake figures for mileage and range. Many buyers might have been misled into buying this looking at the range. Now they might repent. The same thing happened with the Tigor as well.

He said the car EMI is paying by itself with the saving on fuel.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThat is true. However, point to be noted is he is having to charge on a daily basis and needs to maintain the charging infra at multiple places for that kind of usage. So point to be noted is shared public infrastructure is not there. You cannot use the car unless you have planned trips. This is not the car you can just use whenever you feel just because it is standing in your parking. It not only needs to be charged but you need careful analysis of where you are going and how far you are going when you use it. Also, the slow charging cannot be done just off \"any\" 15amp plug. It needs proper earthing and then only it charges correctly. Of course, this charging requirement is not tata specific. It is an ev requirement. But then again, it hampers the usability of the car.  \\r\\nMy advice is you should buy a car if this is your second car which you can use only for city commutes. For highways, please do not even try it as for now. Within the city it is a good car and will save you a lot on fuel compared to ICE cars .  \\r\\nOur requests to Tata : \\r\\n1. Please fix the software bugs, the unpredictable DTE and the range issues which multiple owners are having.\\r\\n2. Please fix your app. You advertise of connected features but none of them work in reality. There is no use of waiting for 1-2 minutes to fire a command from the app without even knowing whether it worked or not. We could reach the car in that time and get stuff done without the app.\\r\\n3. Please get your Fast charger network which has been promised to customers rolling asap. It is seriously hampering usability of the car.\\r\\n4. Please give the option to switch off the regenerative braking. It kills the range on short highway trip considerably.\\r\\n5. Please educate your dealers about your product. It seems customers know more than dealers at this moment. We have had bad service experiences so far because of lack of knowledge at the dealerships.\\r\\n6. Please increase the ev service dealerships considerably. Because Tata is selling this product in every nook and corner of the country but the number of dealerships that can service EVs is just a handful.  \\r\\nAgain I must say, the product is futuristic and good. But overall bundled with dealership experiences and the other issues, as a owner I feel, it is a half baked cake which has been served because market was hot.

This way you can also leave the car when you are not using for longer periods. \\r\\nAs Darthveda said, you need to full charge to 100% but I think this can be done monthly once or once every 3 months to balance the cells in a pack otherwise your BMS does not know the 100% mark ( also to 0% ) and reports wrong range numbers. \\r\\nLess fast charging and other usual suspects.', '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by pseudo_coder   I really wonder how ARAI was able to extract 312 km from the car.

Few snippets from the conversation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t Quote:   \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA month back we did the meet-up,  just after the lockdown ended. By then, in Bangalore, we had already 20  buyers we had come into contact with, and we all said that we have to  meet to know each other. We have a larger forum where we have more than  100 Nexon EV owners nationwide in a WhatsApp group which is where we got  in touch. So we formed a group where all the buyers are from Bangalore,  and started the discussion. We thought the best place would be Nandi  Hills, in and around the range that Nexon EV can provide or travel  across Bangalore city to the place. \\nAt 6 AM, we met near Hebbal  with all our cars. Keeping the distance, we communicated, we had some  quick chats about the car and our experiences, and then we started our  journey towards Nandi Hills. We had a good time. We went around the  Nandi Hill premise that is a road track around Nandi Hills and then we  had a photo op.  \\nWe were able to have an elaborate discussion  during the breakfast meeting, where we shared information about the car,  including performance. Overall, we made this trip of 130-140 km still  maintaining enough charge for commuting through the rest of the day.  \\nThere  is Adishakti motors, on the Outer Ring Road who were very much willing  to allow us to charge our cars in their premise if needed. If someone  needed to charge to reach back to their places, they could. But none of  us used that because we had enough juice in our batteries. The Nexon EV  is able to deliver around 200 km on a full charge, and we didn\\x92t do very  spirited driving. It was a fun get-together, and we were driving at  70-80 km/h speed on the National Highway.

I can be wacky.', in that robotic tone of voice. \\r\\nOn  the sidelines, a praiseworthy task by Pratap Bose, and his team, with  the Nexon FL. Electric, or not, the Nexon now dons an ardent character  and commands an undeniable road presence. \\r\\nI  will not comment on the infrastructure or the lack of it in our country.  Nonetheless, the recent amends in subsidiary policies or incentives for  purchase will go a long way (fingers crossed) in the public  acceptability of electric vehicles - though it left the Japanese,  betting big on the hybrid technology, high and dry. \\r\\nI  will not digress. The Tata Nexon EV is well priced. In my humble  opinion, the price bracket in which the Korean and the British / Chinese  counterparts operate expose the potential buyers to many a brand, many a  product, and many a time the 'value proposition' goes for a toss! \\r\\nOn  the thread, there are many a doubt lingering among the potential  buyers, and the early adopters have had their share of hiccups. \\r\\nLet me also state one of my apprehensions here, apart from the regular range anxiety and others, rightly pointed out by fellow BHPians - the battery is a consumable good with a restrictive life when compared to the internal combustion engine. I have driven ICE powered four wheelers that are more than 70 years of age. I doubt that I will be able to state that for a battery powered vehicle - I am not an expert or aware of any scientific discovery right around the corner. \\r\\nIn such a scenario, how does it affect the resale value of the vehicle, is worth a study. I appreciate that Tata Motors offers an eight years or 160,000 km warranty on its 30.2 kWh li-ion battery. But if I were to buy a second hand vehicle, I would want to know how much juice is still there in it, more so cause the cost of replacement of the battery is still a significant portion of the total cost. \\r\\nWill I make such an investment, today? No! I will buy a new vehicle. For the owner, it implies that his or her electric vehicle is depreciating at a rate far greater than the conventional drive train of the same age. A premium on the cost of acquisition and poor resale value is recipe too tough to swallow - with the cost of ownership still under scrutiny. Please note, this comment is not directed to any specific automobile manufacturer, but EVs in general, today. \\r\\nNonetheless, I reiterate, Nexon EV is a commendable step by Tata Motors  towards the democratization of the electric vehicles.

(If the manufacturers can\\'t, the government should offer this subsidy since the push for EV is very aggressive). This could be a viable market actually. Buy back existing lithium ion batteries from old EVs and recycle them. In return provide a new battery pack which would have greater energy density and probably be offered at a lower price. Win-win for car owner, environment and battery business owners.  \\r\\nSince the electric motors don\\'t have any degradation, the only issue with EVs today is heavy depreciation on batteries and the prospect of better batteries in future at lesser prices. This is a huge psychological barrier for early adopters as the purchase doesn\\'t make financial sense. It is indeed a bad deal as it stands today.

There\\'s also the intangible \"coolness\" factor.  \\r\\nThis is why Tesla went for the very high end aspirational market first to prove the capabilities of EVs and then enticed the rest of the segments with trickle down technologies.

The per kilometer running cost is definitely lower than the ICE cars, but the average lifespan of the battery is one thing which no one talks about. With such rapid use, say a couple of thousand kilometers a month for an average user, how long will the battery survive before it\\'s rendered useless and needs a replacement? \\r\\nPoint number two, the BIG and pinching question, what would be the resale value of the car ideally after 5 years and 60 thousand kilometers (a lower count though). Since an average time the first owner keeps his car is around 5 years. \\r\\nThird point, EVs can\\'t be serviced by regular joes with a set of \\'paana-pakad\\' unlike their ICE counterpart. Emergency breakdown on highways, ease of after-warranty service at FNG is questionable, specifically due to Tata\\'s after-sales service\\'s reputation. \\r\\nThe EVs are still at a very infant stage, hence no one knows what sort of issues and problems the car is going to throw at you down the line. Also in my opinion, until the time battery swap is available at every nook and corner like fuel stations, EVs do not particularly make much sense to me. The Govt. should setup an infrastructure in every fuel pump across the country where \"swap & go\" sort of battery packs are available like LPG cylinders. Getting your vehicle charged every 250 kms is highly impractical. \\r\\nOne more point I\\'d like to add her . The Govt. should make it mandatory for the battery to be of standard dimensions across all segment of EVs, which will allow a faster penetration of the technology into mass market. If an electric bike needs 1 battery, a car should need 4 or 6 of the same size and power, as per the requirement. Just like the standardized form of USB cable. \\r\\nThe bottomline is, I for one, wouldn\\'t be comfortable with an EV unless it\\'s battery is hot-swappable just like fill it, shut it, forget it.

Join the WhatsApp community of owners , it's good .    \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. This car is for my parents in Kerala and will be primarily a city car. The running will be around 5K KM per year. Usage might increase due to the fact that we dont have to pay for electricity; thanks to grid-tied solar setup at home which has been producing more electricity than we consume for the past 4 years.  \\r\\nI have been using an E2O for the past 3 years in Bangalore. I had even booked an E2O plus for my parents few years back, but the car did not have enough power to climb the steep gradient from my parking area to the main road and had to cancel the booking. We've been searching for a powerful EV since then.  \\r\\nWe cannot compare E2O and Nexon EV. E2O is more like a toy, a half baked product that just gets its job done. In an E2O, there is no ergonomics, no suspension, no safety, no boot space. But as a replacement for a 2wheeler that is supposed to transport one or two people from point A to point B within a city, it is a fantastic vehicle. I stopped using my 2 wheelers and my Cruze since the day I purchased the E2O. Last year my E2O did 10K+ KMs while my Cruze hardly ran 2K KMs and my 2 wheeler probably 100KMs. The compact dimensions of the E2O makes it an amazing city vehicle which we can drive through narrow gaps and tight parking spots.  \\r\\nIts too early to comment where and how the Nexon EV fits among these cars. Nexon EV is a proper car and will have to be used as a proper car although with a limited range. It has the safety, comfort, space, features, ergonomics, power and everything that a modern car needs but size and range makes it neither here nor there. I will have to see how it evolves as we drive it more. \\r\\nI will PM you for the whatsapp group info. I would love to be a part of that community.

The sales advisor did mention that most insurances won\\'t even cover the battery etc. Should I ignore that.    \\r\\n\\r\\n1. The batteries definitely will get cheaper, but OEM prices may not reduce that much. I checked the price of my E2O battery with Mahindra and they still claim it will be around 16K per module. Out of 16 modules, 3 have reduced capacity to 85% because of which all the remaining modules were manually recalibrated with 85% capacity reducing my range by 15%. If I change those 3 modules, my range will be back to 100%. I enquired with some Li battery dealers and they have the exact same battery module for around 6K.  \\n2. The laws of physics does apply here. 250+KM with 30KWh (28KWh available) battery might be a far fetch. A super light vehicle like e2o barely manages 80-100Wh per KM. Even with the most efficient and slow driving it is difficult to go below 110Wh per KM with Nexon. I usually average around 115Wh/KM in my Nexon despite having years of driving experience extracting the maximum range in an E2O. At this consumption rate, I may be able to touch 240KM per charge in city conditions after the update (I am yet to update the software). The recent update was to reduce the reserve battery capacity thus making 28KWh capacity available for the user. Before update it was much less. With even more careful and slow driving, you can definitely go beyond 250KMs, but that will need extraordinary patience and with a powerful vehicle like Nexon, it is just a matter of minutes before you fall for temptation to enjoy the acceleration. \\nEdit: Not aware of any OTAs yet for Nexon. You still have to visit the Service center for updates.  \\n3. Battery is covered for accidental damages by Insurance. The 12v aux battery will come under consumables and hence may not get coverage. The sales advisor must be confused with the coverage for Aux battery with main battery. To be on safer side, do take the \"Consumable Cover\" add-on which covers everything from batteries to fluids.', 'Nexon EV sales crosses 2000 mark in 10 months !

The company has stated that in just over 10 months since its launch, the sales of the Nexon EV reached 2,200 units as of November 2020.   \\nThe 1,000th Nexon EV was rolled out in August this year. The next 1,000 units were sold in a record time of 3 months (September-November 2020). The Nexon EV has emerged as the best-selling electric car in India. At present, Tata Motors claims to be leading the EV segment with a 74% market share. \\nThe Nexon EV uses a 30.2 kWh lithium-ion battery that powers an electric motor which has an output of 127 BHP and 245 Nm. The company claims that the car can do a 0-100 km/h sprint in 9.9 seconds. The battery is said to have an ARAI-certified maximum range of over 312 km on a single charge (MIDC cycle). It has fast charging capability and can be charged to 80% of its capacity using a DC fast charger in 1 hour. Using a standard AC charger, it takes 8-9 hours to charge to 100%. \\nThe Nexon EV is priced from Rs. 13.99 lakh – Rs. 16.25 (lakh ex-showroom). It comes with an 8-year / 1.6 lakh km warranty for the battery and motor. Tata Motors has also launched monthly subscription plans for the car.  Link to Team-BHP News Article', \"This is a commendable achievement by Tata! \\nAs things stand, the Nexon EV is the most affordable proper electric car in India. Also, the Nexon happens to be the only car in India that's currently available with a choice of petrol, diesel and electric powertrain options (Tigor diesel and Verito petrol & diesel were discontinued post BS6 implementation). \\nWhat Tata have shown with the Nexon EV is that it's perfectly possible to convert an ICE car platform into a good EV. I wonder what's stopping other manufacturers from doing so? Is it a serious lack of intent or a worry among manufacturers that customers would abandon ICE vehicles quicker than they would like?\", \"It's a great achievement  \\r\\nTata also has Altroz and HBX EVs in the pipeline expected to be released in the next 1-2 years. Those 2 cars will make EVs even more affordable. Hopefully, they continue to improve these EVs every 2 years with bigger batteries as the battery prices continue to decline rapidly.\", \"According to me, this is a tremendous achievement by Tata Motors for two reasons: \\n1. Nobody expected Tata to leapfrog Mahindra (with all their Reva experience) and the rest of the global brands (that have proper EVs in their portfolio already) and come up with a proper EV at a price point Indians could actually afford. \\n2. Despite being beaten to launch by Hyundai and MG, Tata Motors have had the last laugh with the Nexon EV racing ahead in sales. This is a no-brainer as the difference in range between the Nexon EV and it's rivals from MG and Hyundai isn't as significant as their retail prices suggest. \\nGood work, Tata! Now, all they need to do is to get the Altroz EV and HBX EV to the market quickly and build a substantial lead in the nascent but fast-growing EV landscape in India.\", 'The Tata Nexon is the most affordable EV I think right now.

So, the battery lasts longer than the car or any ICE car. \\n2) Battery degradation is not linear, the first year will be like 3%, 2nd year like 2%, 3rd year like 1% after that may be 1% every year. \\n3) After 8 years of warranty the battery does not go kaput, it still has 90% or in the worst case 85%. Which for Nexon EV is atleast 170km. \\n4) Batteries in a car are not similar to that in scooters or the electronics, the biggest difference is cooling, Nexon EV has liquid cooling of batteries. \\n5) As said by Mohan in the earlier post the batteries will sell for better prices after the car is scrapped and the battery can be repurposed for home storage.', \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by Mik   Finally got ours delivered. \\r\\nNew car jitters are real.

Something about it really attracts me. The drive and handling are just about perfect. However, I am disappointed at the features missing from the regular Nexon. ESC has been removed. Cruise control is gone! TPMS has also been removed for unknown reasons. Also worrying is the lack of a ‘P’ option. Instead we have to leave it in neutral with the parking brake on. This seems a little dangerous and I am surprised no one has discussed this. In addition, I would have liked 6 airbags at least on the top variant. HID or LED headlights won’t cost much and should have been provided in the existing projectors. Tata power has also started charging for fast chargers now at around Rs 18 per kwh which is rather steep. Since they had kept them free till now, they should have gone with a low rate like Rs 8 per kwh to promote EV adoption for the next year or two.  \\nAnyone knows how to join the Telegram or Whatsapp group for the NexonEV?', 'In Nexon EV, the main battery supplies power to the 12v battery.

The 12v battery charges from your main battery when the charge level is low and you are not using the lights or wipers. If you are using the lights and wipers continuously your 12v battery drains and will not charge from the main battery. \\nI am sure that your main battery should be recharged before the 12v needs your attention. I am not sure though what happens if we leave the headlights switched ON even when charging the vehicle and denying a chance for the 12v battery to charge. \\nTo your actual question, the 12v battery has less than 3% capacity than the Nexon's main battery. So, in conclusion the range may reduce by 3% if the vehicle decides to charge the 12v battery from the main battery before you reach the next charger. \\nHope this makes sense, correct me if my understanding is wrong.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by StarrySky   In Nexon EV, the main battery supplies power to the 12v battery.

If this was an isolated incident that happened only to him, what you say is fully valid. There have been multiple posts here and I know of atleast 2 friends in Chennai itself facing the same issue. Coincidentally doctors owning multiple cars where Nexon EV stopped midway on the road and the service guys after keeping it for a week or so, say the car has no problems and advise the owner to drive the EV properly. \\r\\nIs the level of customer satisfaction or post-purchase service we\\'re signing up for ?

Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by M00M    I would still recommend him to put his \"you dont know me\" attitude aside for once and check with Tata Motors and figure it out and if its still not up to the mark then identify with the team at Tata Motors whats the issue because the Nexon EV is one of the best EV in the market and this kind of target enmity towards it seems suspect from somebody who doesnt want them to get recognised.    \\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, he has already bought the car, so what enmity do you see ? And he also checked with Tata motors and based on *their* attitude he\\'s complaining as a customer. If he\\'d not reached out to anybody and his first reaction was on twitter/youtube I\\'d certainly agree with you. \\r\\nBTW a friend of mine went to check out Safari at TaMo Chromepet, Chennai. There was nobody to attend him for half an hour when the showroom was empty, apparently all the sales guys were in a meeting. Later a salesperson wasn\\'t even willing to discuss the features of the car as he was apparently busy with something else. My friend wanted to complain to the TaMo customer service but couldn\\'t find it on TaMo website - maybe it was hidden or not placed prominently. \\r\\nMy impression is while Tata has got a relatively good product in Nexon EV, it still suffers from post-sales and customer service drawbacks and needs to improve more there.

I never insulted the gentlemen neither have I roasted him. I am questioning him based on his attitude.  He bought a car, car has performance issues, before showing about whatever he owns or doesn\\x92t own, he should try to either properly learn how to drive that particular car as all cars have a different driving style or tell TAMO to fix it. Now if his driving style is perfect for an EV then there is a problem with the car. And TAMO has to fix it or they should be dragged to consumer court and told them to fix it and be penalised. Last night I saw a nexon ev YouTube video where the people from Pune drove to Goa and back in it by charging once mid way each way and they claim to have got 256 kms while going down hill and 230 kms while going up hill. They have shared all their experiences on YouTube in the video and even answered questions.  \\r\\n2. Enmity I didn\\x92t mean from the gentleman but there is targeted short burst of attacks towards nexon ev. Now if you want to go by the book on range that way Maruti and Honda and Toyota Hyundai etc and all claim to deliver 19 kmpl and even more but never do. So then we should drag them also and complain about them also. Why only target nexon ev.   \\r\\n3. Customer service is not the forte of TAMO and M&M heck even Maruti Honda Toyota and Hyundai Kia have had customer service issues. Heck even the German trio and skoda etc are blasted regularly. It mostly depends on how your service manager is and how good a rapport you have with him. So while I understand his frustration all these things need to be taken into consideration before the purchase. I personally have gone into a Kia and told to wait like how you have mentioned for 20 mins after which no one came and I saw the car and walked out. Have had a similar experience even at Skoda. Recently I went to see the Jeep Compass facelift for a friend and the TD car was in a bad shape at 3800 kms so I told them to fix it otherwise customers wouldn\\x92t buy it. Mind you even the Kia Seltos was rattling at 4500 kms on my TD . \\r\\n4. Thank you for your good wishes on me wishing to buy a nexon ev. I don\\x92t need to change my cars right now for the next few years because all my cars are relatively new and in good condition so when I do have to change I shall go for the latest product at the time in my budget and agreeing with my criteria.  \\r\\nAnd once again I have not attacked the gentleman or you or anyone else for that matter, it is a very Indian thing when someone tells you to update your skills on a new technology people get defensive. I recently drove a vintage convertible car and I kept stalling it as I was not keeping the clutch pressed longer so rather than arguing with them I followed their advice.

Only thing that is completely different with EV is regenerative breaking. Rest all parameters that influence energy/fuel consumption are the same as a conventional car. The more aggressive one is with the throttle the worse will be efficiency. The speed to efficiency correlations are also about the same.  \\r\\nComing back to regenerative breaking, I have been driving an EV for a last few months (Not an Nexon EV). I have tried to adjust my driving style to use maximize regen and tried driving with minimum regen (lifting and coasting like a conventional car). Even with the switch between the extremes, I haven't seen any notable change in the efficiency. This kind of tests have been done by other people on other EVs with similar outcomes.  \\r\\nNexon EV doesn't even feature a variable regeneration levels. In such a scenario, I am not sure what is there to learn beyond what is already know about driving economically.  \\r\\nI like Nexon EV as a product concept, but it currently isn't delivering on few critical aspects.

However if this gentleman car is delivering only 100 kms then there is something wrong with the car maybe some software glitch or battery glitch and all that is expected of a first gen product. I have not bashed anybody. I have only criticised the attitude. He should take TAMO to consumer court if he feels he has been cheated.  \\r\\nI test drove the kona EV it had a very good different levels of regen. The regen in one of the modes was very very instant. But the ride was very very stiff and there was no space behind a 6 footer.  \\r\\nI think once Tesla comes we will have rush of EV activity as manufacturers will not want to loose out to Tesla.

I got mine delivered at the end of Feb and have done 4000 Kms as of today. \\n1. Yes the vehicle had a very low range output for the first couple weeks. But that was because I didn't know how to drive the vehicle and the vehicle's engine itself, being fresh off the shelf, takes some time to get used to being your workhorse. Think of your EV as those domestic-able creatures from Avatar; you both spend some time getting to know each-other. And frankly, if you're too bullheaded for that, it would be in your best interests to do yourself a favor and never buy a vehicle outside of the class you're used to (price/performance-wise). Inevitably though, the tech even in your class will change at some point (such is the nature of tech) and you'll then have to adjust anyways. So you can either do it willingly at your own pace or it will be imposed upon you, whether or not you like it. How you deal with it is your headache. Because with time, technology always changes. Love em or hate em, EVs are here and they're here to stay. In short, don't be this guy: https://i.ibb.co/GpYYCth/Firefox-Scr...6-18-859-Z.png \\n2. With that said, I was getting a range of 175 Kms when I drove off the showroom parking lot. Within a few weeks of me getting adjusted to the car and the car having undergone a full servicing, I was up to 200 Kms of range (Highway+City). As of today, I drive my XZ+ from NCR into Delhi and get a range of 275+ Kms with the AC on 22 degrees/fan speed 3-4. \\n3. The trick is in how you drive the vehicle. Much like ICE vehicles, the harsher you accelerate/decelerate, the lesser range you get. BUT In ICE vehicles, no one really cares because you can stop and refuel anywhere. In EVs, this is an issue because you can't stop and refuel anywhere (yet). Wouldn't be an issue in the future when we have many refueling stations as we have for ICE vehicles. \\n4. I said my range is 275+ because it's actually more than 275 if you drive it at lower speeds with the AC off. Also, EVs hate linear lines on your power graphs. Give em curves. Drive like you were the chauffeur of a celebrity's Maybach S650. Gentle acceleration, minimal braking, more lifting-the-foot-off-the-pedal for decelerating. In addition, the last 10% of the EV's battery has been designed to extract the maximum range possible so those last 10 percentages gives you a lot higher mileage than the rest of the 90. The EV is smart enough to realize that at that particular stage (when you hit 10% charge), you're in a bit of a squeeze and so it starts shutting non-essential systems down one-by-one. No points for guessing how I know this. Just pray you never have to experience it. Your AC, music systems, infotainment screen brightness- all go down one by one once you're below 10%. For some people, it's a scary experience because it feels like the EV is powering down for good. But that's far from true. Like they say, it's a feature, not a bug. Quite literally, in this example. \\n5. As someone on here correctly said, don't trust the DTE. It's adaptive so it bounces all over the place. Not really a drawback, it's just too good to be of any use to a human. That extra layer of being adaptive is what breaks things for us. Anyways, you shouldn't be staring at it too much in any case, even if it's a Tesla, because you don't know whether the last system upgrade broke it. Always keep an eye on your ODO and your real-time battery usage and do the simple, basic, secondary-school math to figure out what your actual DTE is at any given time. Seriously, that should be common sense but it surprises me how it eludes so many people. \\nAnd finally, to the new owner here, congrats and welcome to the club! Don't fret, they removed the armrest, headrest, rear charging slot (from below the AC vent and moved it behind the rear-left seat), center brakelight, arm band and now the physical dials and switches for the infotainment system as well as jacked the prices up of different variants at different times of which XZ+ was repeatedly victim, no matter the slot, making it a poor choice for anyone considering the Nexon EV today. As on the other thread, I don't recommend anyone going for XZ+ trim as of today. If you're short on funds, get an XM. If you want the biggest bang for your buck, get the XZ+ Lux. They've essentially f-ed up the XZ+ with constant price hikes because it was getting too popular and they saw their chance to make some extra moolah on it.

I usually get 200KM range if I drive carefully.    \\r\\n\\r\\nUmm... based on the marketing, my car is doing fine. Not great, not bad. By comparison, I'm concerned about yours. It's not performing within the acceptable range at all. \\r\\nHere's my usual routine everyday for the past 12 days- \\r\\nI wake up in the morning, freshen up, remove the charger from the car to find it's been fully charged, I drive it a total of 110 Kms spanning highways and city streets and by the time I reach my destination, I have the battery reporting 61% charge left. In the evening, I do the same route and reach home with battery now depleted to about 19-20%. That's 220 Km a day with 80% battery. By that calculation, I can easily squeeze out 55 Kms from the remaining 20%. 220 + 55 = 275 Kms. Pretty sure I could increase the range even further if I drive at lower speeds with AC off. \\r\\nMy routine may have changed in the past 12 days but even before that when I was making shorter stretches, my calculation was still pretty much the same. Even back then, based on the performance, I could've predicted the same range for my vehicle i.e. 275+ Kms on a full charge. \\r\\nIt's noteworthy though that when I say I have the AC on, I turn it off periodically when the car is cooled and switch it back on when the interior starts to heat up again. So maybe my actual usage of the AC is actually 50% of the time only. Nevertheless, I've found it has a very negligible impact on the car's range since for the first few days of April, I was managing the entire run without AC and the range was more or less the same. \\r\\nIf I may ask a question, how often do you resort to coasting and gentle acceleration? I do it all the time, especially when on highways. You'll never see my energy consumption graph either having linear jerks in power usage or inching off the baseline too high, even on speeds above 60. You want to take advantage of the fact that an efficient EV like Nexon doesn't slow  as much as an ICE vehicle and therefore negates the need to speed back up.

One thing which people ignored is the high cost of insurance for EV vehicles.  \\r\\nHope such a calculation helps future users as a good reference.    \\r\\n\\r\\nI came to a similar conclusion myself. I easily hit 10,000KM per year when I combine both city and highway travels. \\r\\nBut then when I think about buying one I face few problems which I hope everyone will agree with. \\r\\n1. I live in a society where there are 20 story building and the parking lot is either underground or at ground level. As of now, there is no parking slot where EVs can be charged but society is thinking of parking lots for EVs where the owner will be charged for slot time and current consumption. So that is an additional cost on top of initial cost. \\r\\n2. If I have to travel to my home town, there is a possibility to charge EVs on the way, but based on Nexon's mileage I might need to charge thrice. The travel time as of now easily hits 8 hours and adding these charging time means, even if I start at 5 am in the morning I can't reach my destination before the sun goes down and I don't prefer to drive either in the night or during dusk. So practically the drive might become stressful also currently we don't have a standard charging rate, so we can't be sure that the cost of charging will be even across cities or predictable for now. \\r\\n3. I fall in a bracket where I can't afford to spend anything more than ₹20K on EMIs. I remember buying the current Ritz for a cost of around ₹5.2L 12 years back. Now no decent car with the same engine capability is available at the same cost. My salary has improved year on year based on industry standards, but then the cost of living is growing way too high that forget EVs even an ICE car with the same capabilities are becoming unaffordable luxury items and I don't own a home and still living off rented apartments, so for me, savings is more important because we don't have a practical social security measure which can help live an old aged person with the pension options currently available. So when I think about the future, sometimes I feel a car is an unnecessary depreciating investment. \\r\\nThanks to the current COVID situation my friend now thinks his brand spanking new car is sitting idle while his wallet is leaking money in the range of ₹20K per month (His salary falls around ₹15L per annum bracket). Further because of his back issues, he could buy only a car with a high sitting position and is automatic. Now it's value is going down month by month while it's sitting idle in the parking lot. \\r\\nHence the only way EVs might become a value is when the price comes down considerably and also the mileage is equivalent to ICE. So in my mind for a single car owner, if the total initial cost of 5 seater EV is below ₹10L including the interest on EMIs and it can travel for 450KMs in a single charge, then it's worth considering but I don't think that is imaginable at the least for foreseeable future.\", '    https://youtu.be/qMAgV2M5QVQ          \\nAttempted a 0 to 60km/hr drag run in my Tata Nexon EV measured by my Vbox device called the Racebox pro.

AA showed the song running in the background, as did my phone, but increasing or decreasing the volume would only change the FM sound, as if the volume slider didn't recognize my music playing over AA whatsoever. Annoyed, I gave up after a few attempts and tried Youtube to play music. Voila! Everything works normally! No FM playing in the background and no unnecessary audio cutting off.

So please bear with that. \\nSo I got my car for about 12.5 on road\\nAnd when I check cars24, my model, COULD fetch 8.5 \\nSo that’s 4 lacs spent for 5 years \\nMy daily drive is a mix of city and Highway and I generally get a mileage of 16kmpl and an annual running of 18k kms.\\nSo considering that, the fuel expenses on an average for a year come to around 90k considering the fuel increased from 62 back then to 97 today!  \\nMy 5 years of ownership has been pretty smooth. The maintenance cost I think would be around. Let’s say 10k a year considering battery change and regular service etc. Not including tyres, brake pads etc which would be common in both cars! \\nSo the cost of ownership translates to about 1.8 lacs a year! \\nNow, moving on to Nexon here, I plan on getting the mid variant which could cost me around 14 lacs tops considering the 2.5L subsidy in Maharashtra. And say 20k of electricity charges a year.\\nNow the ultimate question being the resale of this car! EVs are yet unknown entities here and considering the battery technology improvement, 5 years later I am not sure if Nexon’s battery and technology would still be meaningful and in demand with the time then!\\nPlus a slew of eVs might appear in the next 2-3 years!\\nSo if I don’t get a good resale value, this car might turn out to be more expensive than a car which gulps down diesel @100₹/L!\\nA resale value of less than 5lacs makes brezza a good deal! \\nSo should I hold onto brezza and wait for better eVs in the market in the next 2-3 years or get the Nexon now?

Buying an EV is like taking a step forward in the right direction. You choice of EVs both Nexon and Altroz appear capable for our Indian urban runs.\\nTo control the cost of ownership may I suggest you enquire with the dealer possibility to take out extended warranty as the standard warranty of 3 years appears to be rather limiting. It will also be worthwhile to enquire the cost of a service plan which seems to be one way to keep a tab on costs.\\nThe only other variable would be electricity costs which are always on the rise (albeit not as much as Diesel or Petrol price rise). Do you have an option to produce your own electricity using Solar ? I know it is a hefty investment but pays back in long term.\\nRegarding resale value, I am always told that EVs hold their resale value much better than fossil fuel cars. Here in UK, we have examples of 2013 Renault ZOE and Nissan Leafs selling for handsome price by the market standards. I must admit that brands like Tesla are fetching better resale value and I think it is because of customer confidence in the brand. Tata's were not known to inspire customer confidence but I understand that this sentiment is now on decline. \\nPlease keep in mind the fact that EV demand across the world is on the rise and Lithium is in short supply. We are experiencing a wait time of upto 6 months on new EVs in UK which is not helped by Semiconductor shortage. This is one of the reason why traditional manufacturer do not commit to EV as they cannot produce enough in the coming years. This unfortunate situation plays into hands of those lucky who managed to buy an EV, it indirectly guarantees a high resale price for EVs for coming years due to adverse demand supply situation. \\nRegarding battery technology, I expect it to improve over time but that should not affect the value of the car as long as it delivers close to advertised range. \\nMay I suggest you to do your research on your usage requirements and compare it against the advertised range for the EVs you shortlisted. Unfortunately not many EVs manufacturers in India are publishing WLTP ranges, so asking around might be best bet. \\nIf at all possible, it might be a good idea to hire an EV for a few days and try it.\\nThere is a lifestyle change with EVs and how much it affects you depends on your usage requirements. \\nWish you all the best.\", '  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by Jash2709   Plus a slew of eVs might appear in the next 2-3 years!\\nSo if I don’t get a good resale value, this car might turn out to be more expensive than a car which gulps down diesel @100₹/L!\\nA resale value of less than 5lacs makes brezza a good deal! \\nSo should I hold onto brezza and wait for better eVs in the market in the next 2-3 years or get the Nexon now?

The EV tech will only get better with time and hopefully more affordable as well.\", 'Last weekend I finally got a chance to drive the Nexon EV for a good amount of time. I had exchanged it with my friend who bought the car approx 10 months ago. The variant that he has is the top of the line XZ+ I don’t clearly remember the suffix to it and this is the one with white colored leather upholstery. \\nI’ve been driving the Vento TSI now for the past 4 years. The torque and the power of TSI has left me spoilt. Coming from that to the EV I was awestruck. The torque surge that the Nexon throws even in D mode is thrilling! Thank god the tyres were changed to Michelin PST4. \\nSunday morning took the car out for a breakfast drive with a friend to Kyani & Co. for some Bun Maska and chai. The battery after the entire round trip was down to 67 percent. I started the drive with a 93 percent battery. I do not have a charging point at my house so I decided to just google and find the charging stations that were available close to my house and actually try and figure out how to use them. After my return I found one close to my house where I anyways had to go to buy some groceries. The charging station asked me to download some app called Electreefi, the app is no short of bugs. It could not locate my location even if the location services on my phone was switched on. The app wasn’t ready to load any money into the wallet. I had to resort to calling the customer support to help me with the step by step process to get it done. After finally figuring out how to charge the vehicle I had preset a 30 min timer so that it would be on course with me getting my shopping done. I think this has to be the best part of owning an EV. You can charge and your errands also are getting done! I think EV for the city makes perfect sense? I then had almost 90 percent charge in the car and decided to unplug it as it was almost lunchtime and I hadn’t eaten anything after that bun-muska. After pressing on cancel on the screen of the charging station. The screen showed please remove the gun. Tadaaa guess what? The gun was locked. It did not wish to be removed. I had to resort to calling the customer support guy again. He told me to do lock-unlock the car a few time and give it a try. To my agony even that did not help. After a few attempts he asked me to start the car and engage it in D mode. Surprisingly this worked. Till now don’t ask me how, but it did. Thankfully we were able to come back home. The total charge costed me somewhere close to 210 bucks inclusive of GST.  \\nComing to the driving dynamics of the car, the car is super comfortable over bumps and undulations. I think for being a crossover it does a good job. The battery hissing noise is a bit evident inside the cabin but I increased the volume of the music so that I cannot hear that. The speakers that this car comes with is crisp, the balancer works phenomenally. The drawback would be the positioning of the horn, I found it tough to operate as only my thumb could reach it and also sometimes it used to end up pressing the control on the steering. The lack on cup holders on the front door pockets are sorely felt. I had bought a can of coke on my way back but did not find a proper place to keep it. The gear knob takes some time getting used to. I’m still confused as to should I turn it left or right and I end up wrongly shifting it. I found the seats to be comfortable enough for my liking. I think after the current subsidy that the Maharashtra government has announced on EV I think this is worth taking the plunge into the world of EV for someone who might use it on a daily basis. \\nAttaching some photos from my weekend with the EV.

Currently EV manufacturers recommend somewhere around 5:1 AC: DC charging. Meaning, You will need to use AC charging 5 times if yo use DC charging once. This is to ensure Longevity of Battery life. By using DC charging all the time, battery degrades faster and you will lose range within a few years. \\nYou do not have to run a wire from your 10th floor. \\nThe best options for you would be to  \\n1) Run the Wire from you Electricity Meter(Assuming its at the ground floor) and fix a 15A Socket on a wall somewhere near to your usual parking area.

It is quite possible in urban areas like Bombay. There are dozens of chargers all around Bombay, Navi Mumbai etc. You can charge once a week at your convenience if you are ok with waiting around 1 to 2 hours at the charger. Many of these are near restaurants, malls and other businesses areas so you can go eat something or take a walk. Manufacturers do recommend a slow charge after every 4 or 5 fast ones. So once or twice a month, locate a place like a mall that provides slow charging. Either hang out there or take some transport to work or home and then pick up the car in the evening. Many malls provide free charging in Delhi NCR and it might be the same in Bombay. Otherwise find a friend or relative you can visit once a month where you can charge. So despite people's vehement opposition, it is quite possible.\", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by docelectric2020    If  you are to park elsewhere, then run an extension socket from this 15A socket to your car.

The car performed really well. So I did two runs on different days one with A/c turned on and the other without the AC. Being a hilly area with steep inclines I managed 1% for every 1 km. AC or Non AC doesn't make much of a difference. Tried ECON mode several times but it starts fogging up the windscreen and side windows, so didn't find it of much use. \\nWhat I love the most over my Tesla Model 3 is that Nexon is much more silent when it comes to road and wind noise. Also I couldn't hear any rattles in the car unlike my old safari and Model 3. The ride is smooth whereas Model 3 is pretty harsh. The sound system in Model 3 is definitely better but the Nexon didn't disappoint that much. \\nWhat I miss the most is the cruise control or the regular autopilot from Model 3, even a regular cruise control will be a great addition. The annoying thing in Nexon is that initial second lag that it has, I think it is in place for bumper to bumper traffic condition, but that is not something you see in Model 3. \\nFew things they need to add is different Regen levels, as when I was coming downhill the car slowed down way too much and pretty much came to a halt if the decline is not too steep. \\nCruise Control is a must. \\nThe Hill assist is annoying, I would have preferred a hill hold feature. There were couple of times where cars in front of me came to a standstill and I had to stop on the incline. Now cars behind don't leave you much room, so you have to do the old way of pulling the handbrake and then accelerating. Because the hill assist lets your car roll back little and the it accelerates ahead. But by that time you have already banged into the bumper of car behind. So I don't trust it much.   \\nThis car won't be that successful during the winter time in areas where it snows a lot and temperature drops too much. My Model 3 loses 40% of its range during winter time, the regen is disabled while the battery is cold and even though it got the heat pump, still it doesn't make much of a difference. So have to see how will Nexon perform.  \\nOverall its a really good package and will only improve from here. Tata customer service has been good so far, atleast you get a human to talk to unlike Tesla where emails go unanswered and if you come across a human then god must be looking after you that day. \\nIn terms of comfort I can say the Tesla seats are bit better and little wide, found Nexon seats a bit narrow, but I love the rear seat comfort of Nexon. The floor height of Model 3 is way too high, like your knees are pretty much in your chest. \\n Happy so far with the purchase and feel proud of what Tata has achieved and hope someday the Harrier comes as an EV and I'll be the first in line to order it.   \", \"  Quote:    \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOriginally Posted by officer416   Did a range test by visiting a popular tourist destination in my state.

But, it is being used as their primary car now. Seven-eight months back, only 45 per cent of customers wanted EV as a first car, but today 60 per cent of them want it as a primary car. Once the primary car usage of EVs starts increasing, it is an indication of mainstream buyer. And this is the big change that we have seen. Also, although Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle (FAME) incentive is not applicable to the personal segment, the State government incentives which are coming says that if the car is compliant to the FAME scheme it is applicable, and we have taken FAME certificate for both (Tigor EV and Nexon EV). So, if I want to sell in the fleet Nexon EV, we'll get the FAME incentive because it is below ₹15 lakh and we meet the localisation requirement as per the FAME phased manufacturing plan. We are the only one who qualifies for the State incentives. So with this, there is an explosion of demand now, which is not getting reflected in the numbers because numbers are limited to the supplies. But, just to give you an idea Nexon EV bookings are equal to the bookings of Nexon Diesel, which is also a successful variant. Seven cities including Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru are nearly 60 per cent of our demand.

Whether it's a fan or an EV motor, if you manually rotate it, it becomes a dynamo, ie it generates electricity. But that doesn't come free, you need to apply force to turn it, ie there's resistance. That's how regenerative braking works. The motor keeps spinning because of inertia, it generates electricity to charge the battery, that causes resistance that feels like strong engine braking.  \\nTo the question of parking an EV: I don't know the answer.

I want it primarily because I like cars which have good acceleration. Some of my previous cars are the Vento TSI, Cruze, Getz CRDi and the Palio GTX.

My second question is whether I need to drive at a max of 80 KMph and avoid sudden acceleration and deceleration to do it.    \\r\\n\\r\\nI think you are the perfect candidate for a Nexon EV. I would suggest even Tigor EV, which saves you a bit of money and should inherently bit more efficient than Nexon, due to it's sedan design (less frontal area =  reduced air drag). \\nBefore I had my Tesla model 3 (SR+), I had been using Ioniq electric (28kWh) and BMW i3 (33kWh/94Ah) for some months (at different points in time) as my only car. The Nexon EV is comparable in range to these 2 models, with Ioniq being a bit efficient but with lower capacity battery and i3 with a bit larger capacity & less efficient. Nexon falls right in the middle in terms of capacity and qua efficiency is more on i3's side. So I guess I can give you some practical insights. \\nHere is a comparison of Ioniq and i3, regarding range and charging :   \\nMy home work commute is 76km (42-45min) oneway and I had options to charge at home (Type 2/11kW) and office (16A / 3kW). But, most of the days I don't even charge at office as I can easily get ~180kms in both cars (10-90% SoC). Note that I just set climate control comfortably and accelerate quickly. I don't baby the cars because it is an EV. Somedays when I want to go somewhere (shorter/locally) in the evening just after coming back home, then I would plug it in office so that I can come home and immediately depart without charging time needed. In your case, probably you have to consider these scenarios as well. Only during winter, I will have to plug in the cars at office to top up so that I will not go below 10% SoC on my way back home. But with our weather in India, we don't have to worry about efficiency dropping due to heater usage (unless you are living in colder regions). \\n( OFFTOPIC: Actually Ioniq and i3 experience made me confident to choose a model 3 SR+, inspite of me having the option to choose Long range. I chose SR+ as it is more than enough for my use case and it is ~250kgs lighter than LR. Lighter the car, nimble it is to flick in corners. Also in 2019, when i got mine, model 3 SR+ was using the same rear motors as Model 3 LR AWD Performance. And normal LR AWD was using a different rear motor. Now-a-days SR+ and LR AWD use the same motor, while LR AWD performance uses a different motor. ) \\nOther downside you have to consider is the power cuts we have in India, esp. if you workplace does not have a power backup. Here in NL, I have never faced any power outage in the last decade since I came here. So I didn't have to worry about this part. But BLR-Chennai corridor is getting fast charging infrastructure faster than some skeptics have ever imagined. So for long run, I don't think you have to bother about power cuts when you are at work. Check for www.plugshare.com for EV chargers near your location. I see charging companies and users updating these frequently. \\nIMO, you should be good with either new TigorEV or NexonEV.

I have heard that petrol cars can not refuel at home while you  sleep? How often do you have to refill elsewhere? Is this several times a  year? Will there be a solution for refueling at home? Which parts will I need service on and how often? The car  salesman mentioned a box with gears in it. What is this and will I  receive a warning with an indicator when I need to change gear? Can I accelerate and brake with one pedal as I do today with my electric car? Do I get fuel back when I slow down or drive downhill? I assume so, but need to ask to be sure. The car I test drove seemed to have a delay from the time I  pressed the accelerator pedal until it began to accelerate. Is that  normal in petrol cars? We currently pay about 0.5 Rupees per Km to drive our electric car. I  have heard that petrol can cost more than 10 times as much so I reckon we  will lose some money in the beginning. We drive about 20,000 Km a  year. Let's hope more people will start using petrol so prices go down. Is it true that petrol is flammable? Should I empty the tank and  store the petrol somewhere else while the car is in the garage? Is there an automatic system to prevent gasoline from catching fire or exploding in an accident. What does this cost? I understand that the main ingredient in petrol is oil. Is it  true that the extraction and refining of oil causes environmental  problems as well as conflicts and major wars that over the last 100  years have cost millions of lives? Is there a solution to these  problems? I have heard that cars with internal combustion based engines are  being banned to enter more and more cities around the world, as it is  claimed that they tend to harm the environment and health of their  citizens?? Is that true??   I may have more questions later, but these are the most important  ones to me at the moment.  Thank you in advance for your reply.\", \"Mod Note: No more off-topic posts please.

He was assured the both the cars (Dinar\\'s and Mine) would be definitely delivered from the next lot.\\n- On 17th February 2022, Dinar\\'s car reached the stockyard but mine didn\\'t. On asking the dealer they said they had only received 1 XZ+ Dark Edition and one Lux variant. When I asked why my car wasn\\'t dispatched despite being promised, the dealer said that they can\\'t do anything if Tata does not give them cars.\\n- I then contacted Mr. Ramzaan who said that they had dispatched 2 XZ+ cars, one of which was delivered to Yuri. So where did the 2nd car go? And this was from the previous lot. I would have still kept quiet if they had sent 2 cars in the 17th February lot.\\n- I also questioned the dealer on this issue. They were quick to cover up by saying that the 2nd car was a Lux variant despite Mr. Ramzaan confirming that 2 XZ+ Dark Editions were dispatched. Later they had some internal discussions and took a common stand that there was some misunderstanding and the 2nd car was a Lux variant.\\n- While this was going on we also noticed that other people were taking deliveries of Dark Editions particularly from the newly opened (December 2021) Panjim branch of SP Motors. We saw cars being delivered as well as photos on Social Media. We also came to know that some customers got their cars within 20 days of booking. The dealer responded that those were old bookings. I asked them, if they were old bookings how come you did not tell us that these people are in line before us. They said that they do not have data of bookings from the Panjim showroom. Well if that was the case then the bookings had to be made after mine as I booked in November and the Panjim showroom opened in December. To this they replied that the staff of the Panjim showroom was operating from the Nuvem showroom prior to December. Now this is really hard to believe as it is very unlikely that the dealer is unaware of bookings made at their branches as the all the orders are placed collectively.\\n- I spoke to the GM Sales of SP Motors Mr. Amey who denied any out of turn deliveries. He also said that there were customers before me whom he was bypassing in order to help me. These were customers who had not taken delivery due to financial issues or waiting for the subsidy to be announced.\\n- The dealer offered me the option of taking either a Dark Edition Lux or a White or Teal XZ+ variant. I was not interested but I said I would consider if a substantial discount was offered. Now how did they have these cars in stock when cars are ordered only against bookings and Tata only dispatches cars against orders. The dealer claims that Tata pushes them to take XM and Lux variants. Why would Tata do that? There are dealers all over India who would be having bookings for these variants. If there were no bookings Tata would have not produced them and concentrated on the variants that were in demand.\\n- I also gave them the option of giving me a demo car to use till the delivery of my car as this whole mess was created by them and they have not honoured their verbal commitment on delivery dates. They declined stating that they have Test Drives scheduled and cannot cancel them. However when I was asking for my 2nd Test Drive, I was told that it had to be scheduled a few days later as the car was with one of the Municipal Councils in South Goa for a few days as they wanted to Test the car prior purchasing. They are now denying this.\\n- I am a seafarer by profession. I am scheduled to be on standby for joining my ship from 20th February onwards. I had booked the car on the assurance that I would get delivery in January and have at least a month to drive the car. I explained to them that had they not given a false commitment, I could have explored some other options (Non EV) and had fun driving.\\n- I then demanded to speak to some higher ups in Tata. After a lot of pushing they finally agreed and put me on conference call with Mr. Ramzaan and Mr. Ankur Singh. I explained the situation to him. He initially took the side of the dealer stating that there are 27 booking before me. When I told him, that I have booked a Dark Edition and I was informed that I was 3rd in line he finally agreed to make sure my car was \"delivered\" in February. I asked for the same in writing to which he said that he would instruct the dealer to do so via e-mail.\\n- I didn\\'t receive the same. The next day after several calls to the dealer, I received the mail in the evening. However the mail stated that the car would be \"billed\" on or before 28th February 2022. The time between billing and delivery is usually 8-10 days. I quickly pointed out the same to the dealer who refused to change it stating that these were the instructions from Tata. I tried to contact Mr. Ramzaan several times but he refused to answer my calls. He also read my WhatApp messages but did not reply. Finally yesterday (18th February 2022), I went to the dealership and demanded to be put in touch with Mr. Ankur Singh. After a long discussion he agreed to send the mail by evening. I asked him what happens if the dealer says he can\\'t deliver as Tata has not dispatched the car. To that he said, \"If you are looking for compensation, I will put delivery by 15th March 2022 failing which compensation will be provided\". I told him I was interested in getting the car not the compensation.\\n- Anyway till midnight there was no mail. I sent him a reminder. This morning I received a reply that he was travelling so could not send the mail. He sent a mail stating that \"We are hopeful to deliver vehicle on or before 28th February 2022\". I sent him a reply that as per our conversation the commitment was supposed to be to \"definitely\" deliver the vehicle not \"hopefully\". I am still waiting for his reply.\\n- During our last conversation he had also assured me that my vehicle is going into production on 18th February 2022. However at the time of writing this post, the vehicle has not yet been billed. \\nThis has been my side of the story.

In city, the regen is actually quite useful as you can truly achieve single-pedal driving. On the highway (and even in the city), you can opt for the S mode which significantly reduces the regen, however makes the accelerator more responsive.

No long highway runs\\n• Stiffer suspension than the regular Tigor means you feel more of the road. Bad roads are felt\\n• Power tapers off after 100 km/h; top speed of just 120 km/h\\n• Smaller 316L boot (regular Tigor = 419L) due to the intrusive spare tyre\\n• Some misses such as \"P\" mode on the shifter, adjustable regen braking & alloy wheels\\n• A rare Tata car that cannot seat 5 (best for 4 adults)\\n• Tata\\'s after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble\\n• It\\'s a brand-new technology, so there will be issues & niggles  This review has been jointly compiled with Aditya & GTO. Thanks to them for the expert observations!   Introduction \\nTata has been proudly selling India\\'s most affordable \"proper\" electric car, the Nexon EV for a while now. And it has been rewarded too = in July & August, the company has moved ~600 units of the Nexon EV. More important than that though is how these sales & heavy customer feedback help the company learn more about the game-changing EV technology. To widen its reach, Tata now introduces the even more affordable Tigor EV. Electric vehicles are going mainstream - there\\'s no doubt and this is definitely a sigh of relief for people who are fed up with pollution levels & the rising prices of fossil fuels.  \\nDo note this isn’t the first-ever Tigor EV. Back in 2017, Tata Motors won a tender to supply 10,000 Tigor EVs to the government-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), and the car was later made available to select rental services like Zoomcar. However, that was more of a learning experiment. The car you see here is quite different from the previous one and is made specifically keeping the private car owner in mind.  \\nThe 2021 Tigor EV gets a Permanent Magnet Synchronous motor (instead of an AC induction motor) that puts out 74 BHP & 170 Nm (34 BHP & 65 Nm more), as well as a larger 26 kWh battery pack which gives the car an ARAI-certified range of 306 km (164 km more). You can expect a real-world range of ~200 km. There’s plenty more to talk about the drivetrain, so keep reading. The Tigor EV is offered in 3 trims – XE, XM, XZ+ (with a dual-tone option available in the XZ+ variant) and 2 colour options - Signature Teal Blue (our test car) and Daytona Grey.   Tata Tigor EV Price & Brochure\\nPrior to the launch, there were rumours that the Tigor EV would be a sub-10 lakh rupee car. Clearly, that’s not been the case. The Tigor EV has been launched at the following prices; XE - Rs. 11.99 lakh, XM - Rs. 12.49 lakh, XZ+ - Rs. 12.99 lakh and XZ+ Dual Tone - Rs. 13.14 lakh (ex-showroom). Compare these prices with the equivalent petrol-powered variants of the car and there’s obviously a massive difference. Variant to variant, the price premium is ~5.5 lakh (petrol automatic vs electric)! This is a lot & clearly just for early adopters, but for someone who’s looking at an entry-level electric car, the Tigor EV is one of the cheapest options on sale currently. \\nThat being said, we will tell you that the Nexon EV is priced not too far away. The Nexon EV XM variant starting @ Rs 13.99 lakhs is totally worth the price difference. It is the superior car.    \\nYou can download the 2021 Tata Tigor EV brochure here - Tata Tigor EV Brochure.pdf  Incentives \\nApart from the central government\\'s incentives, states are offering additional perks to promote the use of electric vehicles. Maharashtra recently revised its EV policy, which capped the total incentive on electric 4-wheelers at Rs. 2,75,000. This includes a basic incentive of Rs. 1,50,000, an early-bird incentive of Rs. 1,00,000 and a scrappage incentive of Rs. 25,000. Incentives totalling Rs. 1,75,000 will be offered on vehicles purchased after December 31, 2021. Also, the registration and road tax has been waived off on all EVs.  \\nFurthermore, income tax benefits are available under section 80EEB (only applicable for vehicles registered by individuals) - click here to read a detailed article on the same.    Running Costs \\nGiven the high prices of fossil fuels, the cost of running a vehicle has been a pain point for many. Let’s run down simple math for the Tigor EV. The battery capacity is 26 kWh, which means it will need 26 units of electricity for a 100% charge. The per-unit cost of electricity depends on the slab that you are in & your location, but on average, it’s about Rs. 8 per unit. In this case, you’ll be paying Rs. 208 for a full charge. While the ARAI certified range is 306 km, you can expect a real-life driving range of ~200 km under normal driving conditions. Translated, you’ll be paying just Rs. 1.04 per km which is an incredibly sweet figure. This number feels even more impressive when you consider that the average petrol compact sedan costs you 8 - 9 bucks / km (FE of 12 in the city), while a diesel will cost you 6 - 7 bucks (FE of 15 in the city).   Want to know more about EVs?  Read GTO\\'s excellent article (Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head) on the topic.  Exterior  Design & Styling \\nThe Tigor has always been a smart-looking sedan, and there are a few design elements to differentiate the EV variant. For starters, the signature \\'Teal Blue\\' paint shade and black roof are exclusive for the Tigor EV. Then, multiple blue accents at different locations and the \\'EV\\' badges, further remind you that it’s an EV. The best part for owners will be the green number plate, which many wear as a badge of honour!   Build Quality, Fit & Finish \\nThe build is solid and the car doesn’t feel flimsy at all. With a kerb weight of 1,235 kilos, the Tigor EV is heavy. The hefty battery pack contributes significantly to its weight.  \\nFit & finish of some of the parts could have been better though. As an example, the blue highlight below the front grille on our test car was slightly misaligned. Then, the ORVM glasses on our test car kept shaking & vibrating over bad roads. The Teal Blue paint, on the other hand, is of good quality and has a nice, glossy finish.   Wheels & Tyres \\nThe top variant of the regular Tigor is offered with 15-inch alloy wheels wrapped with 175/60 section rubber. The Tigor EV comes with 14-inch steel wheels & 175/65 section tyres. Sadly, no alloy wheels! Our test car was shod with Apollo Amazer XP series rubber, which are low resistance tyres specifically designed for efficiency. The steel wheels are offered with wheel covers that make them look like alloy wheels. No doubt, these 14-inch rims do look small for the size of the car.  \\nThe Tigor EV is heavier than the regular Tigor by ~200 kg, and since the battery pack is sitting below the boot, there is more weight at the rear. Hence, the recommended pressure for the front tyres is 33 PSI, while that for the rear tyres is 38 PSI.  Ground Clearance \\nTo bear the additional weight, Tata has made changes to the suspension as well. As a result, the Tigor EV has an unladen ground clearance of 172 mm, which is 2 mm more than the regular Tigor.   Standard & Extended Warranty \\nThe Tigor EV is offered with a standard warranty of 3 years / 125,000 km, which is 1 year more than the regular Tigor. Details of the extended warranty haven’t been revealed yet, but you must make an entry in your to-do list and take it (new technology after all). You get an 8 year / 160,000 km warranty on the battery pack and electric motor as standard.  Maintenance \\nThe Tigor EV has a service interval of  6 months / 7,500 km. EV maintenance is far simpler than ICE cars as there are no oil changes & filters to carry out.   Safety \\nThe Tigor EV has scored a commendable 4-stars in the Global NCAP crash tests. The car comes with dual airbags, ABS + EBD + corner stability control, reverse parking camera and sensors, hill descent control and hill ascent assist. Apart from this, the battery pack and motor get an IP67 rating which means they are dustproof & waterproof.  Interior    Cabin Design & Quality \\nNothing has changed on the inside, except for a small handful of cosmetic bits and feature additions. Tata introduced the dual-tone black & white dashboard with the Tigor facelift and the same is seen on the EV too. The only changes here are the blue accents on the dashboard and the new seat fabric design.   Unique & Noteworthy Features \\nThe Tigor EV comes with almost all the features you’d expect in a compact sedan. These include a 7-inch touchscreen head-unit with Android Auto & Apple CarPlay and a digital instrument cluster. You also get iRA (Intelligent Real-time Assist) connected technology, which offers features like intrusion alert, remote immobilization, geofencing, time fencing, remote door lock/unlock, remote cooling, remote vehicle diagnostics, trip analytics etc.    Boot Space \\nThis is where things have changed drastically compared to the regular Tigor. Since the battery pack is placed under the boot, the spare wheel is actually kept inside the boot on the right-hand side! This noticeably chews away boot space. As a result, the Tigor EV has a 316-litre boot compared to the regular Tigor’s 419-litre unit.', 'Driving the Tata Tigor EV\\r\\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor puts out 74 BHP & 170 Nm of torque. That\\'s far lower than the Nexon EV\\'s 127 BHP & 245 Nm:  \\r\\nBefore we get to the driving part, let\\x92s get some basics right. There are 3 main components in an EV \\x96 the battery, the motor and the controller/charger. The battery is what stores the energy and the motor is what uses that energy to move the car. The controller/charger converts the energy from the battery into a usable form to power the motor. In more technical terms, the power grid from your house or a charging station is usually an AC current. The lithium-ion battery can store electric energy in DC form. So while charging, there\\x92s usually an AC/DC converter that will convert the power grid\\'s AC into DC and store it in your car\\x92s battery. The DC fast chargers that you see usually have the AC/DC converter inbuilt, which is how they can charge your car\\x92s battery faster. The controller typically sits on top of the motor. In the case of the Tigor EV, the controller and motor are placed under the bonnet.  \\r\\nNow, let\\x92s get to the driving part. Most of us are still getting used to the eerie silence of EVs after pressing the start/stop button. But it takes just a couple of drives to feel comfortable with it. \"Start\" the car and its digital speedometer goes all the way up to 160 km/h, then dropping back to 0. There are 4 transmission modes to choose from \\x96 D, R, N and S. \\x91D\\x92 mode is more designed for city driving conditions, while \\x91S\\x92 mode is when you want that extra power (at the cost of FE, which in this case is the battery charge level). We sure wish there was a \"P\" (park) mode like the Hyundai Kona & MG ZS EV which would lock the wheels in place. Right now, your only option is \"N\" with the handbrake. Tata should fix this in its future EVs.  \\r\\nAs a safety feature, the car will always start in \"N\" mode. Engage D, take your foot off the brake pedal and the Tigor EV gets off the line in a perfectly smooth manner, crawling at 6 km/h. It\\x92s very linear and without any jerks. With 170 Nm of torque available from 0 rpm, Tata claims that the Tigor EV has a maximum restart gradeability of 29-degrees. Meaning, the car can crawl forward from a standstill on an incline of up to 29 degrees with ease. \\r\\nDriving around in \"D\" mode within the city is a super convenient affair. No clutch, no gears, no turbo lag & no noise means even a newbie driver will seem like a smooth driver. The motor has sufficient torque, but it is used conservatively in \"D\" mode for a smoother driving experience & to maximise driving range. Think of \"D\" being more like \"ECO\" mode. Performance in D mode is decent, but that\\'s it. You won\\x92t have any issues keeping up with city traffic & power is sufficient for day-to-day commuting. When you want to suddenly accelerate from say 40 - 50 km/h though, you will feel the power deficit & it feels like a 1.2L NA petrol! If you want quicker acceleration, simply switch to \"S\" mode and you\\x92ll notice a BIG difference in the way the power is put down. Throttle response is much sharper and you get a stronger surge of power. Added bonus = in \"S\", you\\'ll see the power gauge on the left showing a redline at the limit (via 3 red bars), just like a conventional rev counter.  \\r\\nOut on the open road, D mode is adequate for regular drivers. You can cruise comfortably on the expressway. However, if you need to execute an overtaking manoeuvre quickly, S mode comes in handy. You\\'ll also find yourself engaging \"S\" mode whenever you are in the mood for some fun. The Tigor EV feels peppy in Sport mode, even on the open road. Power is delivered strongly till 100 km/h, after which it starts to taper off. The Tigor EV\\'s top speed is limited to an indicated 122 km/h (GPS showed 116 km/h) and progress from 110 - 120 km/h is quite slow. Must add that electric cars aren\\'t good at high-speed cruising, from the range point-of-view. Drive continuously at 110 - 120 km/h in \"S\" mode and you\\'ll see the battery level drop alarmingly fast. That\\'s one of the reasons you\\'ll see most EVs driving at 80 - 90 km/h on the expressway in the middle lane.   Regenerative Braking  \\r\\nUnlike some other EVs like the Hyundai Kona or MG ZS EV, you cannot adjust the level of regenerative braking in the Tigor EV. That sucks as we\\'d like the option to select, depending on the driving condition or individual preferences. There\\x92s just one standard level of regenerative braking and it is quite mild compared to other EVs. Tata says they have kept it mild based on feedback from Nexon owners and for a smoother drive experience. Can\\x92t argue with that; regen does take getting used to, especially if it\\'s aggressive. Tata has provided a regen meter on the instrument cluster with 6 bars to show you how much energy you are regenerating. The maximum regeneration that we saw under heavy braking is 4 bars worth.  \\r\\nAgain, we really wish Tata gave adjustable regen levels in the Tigor EV, as enthusiasts who like engine-braking in ICE cars usually prefer the higher regen settings. On the highest setting, you can also do one-pedal driving in many situations. Plus, aggressive regen can be used to maximise range.   Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) \\r\\nWell, there\\x92s no engine noise for starters! The only sound coming is a faint whirring by the electric motor. No gearshifts & minimal mechanical parts mean no jerks or vibrations. On the highway, tyre noise starts creeping into the cabin early at 80 km/h. You\\'ll hear it more because there is no engine sound to drown some of it out.   Range \\r\\nRange anxiety is a big concern with EVs. However, it\\x92s only when you are pushing the car hard that you\\'ll notice the range and battery percentage falling at a rapid pace. The ARAI-certified range for the Tigor EV under standard test conditions is 306 km, but under normal driving conditions, you can expect a range of ~200 km. 200 km is enough for those intending to drive primarily in the city.   Charging \\r\\nTata Motors has been working with its sister company, Tata Power, to improve the charging infrastructure levels. There were about 60 Tata charging stations in January 2020. The number has grown to 640 this August.  \\r\\nThat said, we can tell you that the best place to charge your EV is at home. Cheapest + most convenient. At an average cost of Rs. 8 per unit, you\\x92ll be paying Rs. 208 for a full tank at home.  \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets a CCS Type 2 charging port, which is currently the standard for electric vehicles in India. The estimated charging time from 0-80% from a 15A plug point is about 8 hours & 45 minutes. A 25 kW DC fast charger can charge the batteries to 80% in 65 minutes. For a DC fast charger, you will have to pay ~Rs. 18-20 per unit. So a full tank would be Rs. 520 in just over an hour.  Suspension    Ride Comfort \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets a MacPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam dual-path strut suspension at the rear. It rides on 14-inch rims shod with 175/65 section tyres. The recommended tyre pressure rating is 33 PSI at the front and 38 PSI at the rear. This makes sense as the battery pack has been placed directly above the rear suspension.  \\r\\nLike most fossil fuel cars converted to electric, the Tigor EV\\'s suspension has been stiffened up due to the heavy battery pack it is carrying. You\\'ll notice the firmer suspension as soon as you start driving the car. Over some mildly uneven roads in the city at slow speeds, there is a fair bit of movement in the cabin and it even feels jiggly at times. You feel more of the road in the Tigor EV, but still, ride quality is liveable & compliant enough on most city roads. It\\'s only the really big bumps that come in strong, as do the sharp road dips. On the other hand, the Tigor EV rides rather flat on the expressway.   Handling & Dynamics \\r\\nThere are a couple of things that aid the handling characteristics of the Tigor EV. Firstly, it\\x92s the firmer suspension and secondly, the heavy mechanicals (battery pack + motor) that lower the centre of gravity. High-speed stability is very good and you\\x92ll be doing 110 - 120 km/h on the expressway without feeling nervous at all.  \\r\\nGet on some twisty roads and you\\x92ll appreciate the stiffer suspension. The car feels agile and you can carry good speed into corners. The suspension setup does complement the chassis well and the Tigor EV holds its line nicely by family sedan standards. Changing direction on back-to-back corners is no problem either. Earlier, I had apprehensions that the heavy battery pack at the rear might cause some imbalance, but we didn\\'t face any problem on our (admittedly) limited test drive. The only issue is the 175/65 section rubber which is meant for maximizing range and not for pushing hard into corners. On a particularly wet day outside Mumbai, the only factors keeping us from driving the car aggressively on curvy roads were the tyres and the alarmingly fast depletion of the battery charge! Yes, the battery level drops rapidly if you drive like a BHPian.   Steering \\r\\nThe electric power-assisted steering is a nice unit and is super light at parking speeds. The turning radius of 5.1m is user-friendly and you can manoeuvre the car easily with gentle inputs on the steering. It weighs up adequately as you gain speed. However, the EPS is dead and there\\x92s not much feel or feedback from it.   Braking \\r\\nThe Tigor EV gets disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. Their performance, in general, is satisfactory. However, we feel that wider tyres would definitely improve the braking performance of the car. Another sore point is that, like most EVs, the brake pedal has a spongy & rubbery feel. It feels weird at first.', \"Tata Tigor EV Exterior Images\\nThe Tigor EV is based on the Tigor Facelift and gets a few changes to the exterior that announce it as an electric car. Changes to the front include a different grille and air dam design:  \\nThe rear hasn’t changed much even from the original Tigor. Changes include redesigned tail-lamps, a tweaked bumper & no tail-pipe :  \\nIn profile, the 14-inch wheels shod with 175/65 section tyres look a size too small on the Tigor EV, especially since the regular Tigor XZ+ variant gets nice-looking 15-inch alloy wheels. But then, because the suspension has been firmed up, these 14-inchers + taller sidewalls are better from the ride quality POV than the 15s:  \\nThe Tigor EV measures 3,993 mm in length, 1,677 mm in width and 1,532 mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2,450 mm:  \\nGoing electric means the Tigor has put on ~200 kg. The additional weight had to be balanced by a stiffer suspension that has also led to the ground clearance going up by 2 mm (172 mm):  \\nThe solid front grille gets a single opening in the middle with the characteristic tri-arrow design at either end. The trim below the grille is finished in blue for the Tigor EV:  \\nProjector headlamps were introduced in the Tigor Facelift. They’re offered only on the top-end XZ+ variant:  \\nA closer look at the tri-arrow design and the EV badging on the grille:  \\nThe air dam at the bottom has a nice mesh-like design with the same tri-arrow detailing. Also, check out the sharp design on the lip:  \\nFoglamp housings also get the blue EV touch. LED DRLs are placed next to the foglamps:  \\nThe blue insert below the grille was misaligned in our car. Not cool, Tata! You really need to get your build right. The ORVM glasses of a demo that GTO drove were shaking & vibrating on bad roads:  \\nA look at the underbody from the front. Being an EV, we would’ve expected the Tigor to have a healthy amount of underbody protection, but it doesn't:   \\nPlenty of EV badging to let you know this Tigor is different:  \\nORVM covers are finished in black for this dual-tone variant:  \\nAll 4 door handles get chrome treatment. The driver's door gets a request sensor:  \\n14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers that make them look like alloy wheels. The blue accent on the wheel cover is a neat touch:  \\nThe black roof looks great on the Tigor EV; the premium one has to pay for the dual-tone variant is ~Rs. 15,000:  \\nSmart & tight rear. An EV badge on the top right, a Ziptron badge on the bottom right & a blue strip on the bumper will tell you it's the battery-powered variant:  \\nAlways loved the design of the spoiler-integrated HMSL of the Tigor. What’s new is the sharkfin antenna on top:  \\nA closer look at the clear lens tail-lamp. Very smart. You get LED elements in the split tail-lamp design:  \\nYou get a single reversing light on the left and two reflectors. The light next to the RHS reflector is a dummy. Not done, we wish there were two reversing lights:  \\nLook underneath and you will see the battery pack, just behind the rear suspension:  \\nBattery specifications are mentioned on the battery itself. Look at the weight of the battery pack. 165 kilos!  \\nThese orange high voltage cables are a sore sight. In road conditions like ours, these wires should definitely have been better protected & concealed: \", 'Tata Tigor EV Interior Images\\r\\nWhile the interiors are largely similar to the standard Tigor, there are a few \"EV\" touches in the cabin. The new flat-bottom steering wheel of the Tigor Facelift is good to hold. What\\x92s even nicer is that it is soft:  \\r\\nButtons for the audio system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. A useful mute function has been provided (long press to mute). Notice the small horn symbol (next to steering buttons on both sides) - extended horn-pad! The plastic on the spokes doesn\\x92t feel very premium. Should\\x92ve gotten the piano black treatment like in the Tiago NRG (reference image):  \\r\\nFully digital instrument cluster gets a blue EV highlight around it. The meter on the left shows how much power is being used (dependent on the accelerator input, similar to an ICE-car\\'s rpm counter). You have a battery level indicator on the top right and below that, you get the Regen meter (6 bars). The screen in the middle displays the speed, charge level, transmission mode, distance to empty etc.:  \\r\\nAir vents get some blue love too:  \\r\\nThe dual-tone theme from the dashboard continues to the door pad. The area above the armrest gets a fabric insert which is a welcome touch:  \\r\\nEV-specific seat upholstery gets contrast blue stitching. The driver\\'s seat is adjustable for height:  \\r\\nA closer look at the fabric upholstery:  \\r\\nPeople with a big shoe size might find the pedals placed too close to each other. Pedal travel is on the shorter side. You get a well-sized dead pedal to rest your foot. Notice the exposed wiring above the pedals:  \\r\\nGood to see the \"fuel\" flap release lever marked properly!!!  \\r\\nThe 7-inch Harman touchscreen is basic, yet packs all the features that you would need from a touchscreen. The home screen gets a split display and the touchscreen overall is pretty convenient to use, with very little lag:  \\r\\nThe car gets 4 speakers and 4 tweeters which have the usual audio adjustments. Sound quality is good by compact sedan standards. You also have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Touchscreen doubles up as a display for the reversing camera, which gets adaptive guidelines:  \\r\\nThe Tigor EV offers iRA connected car technology, which includes features like intrusion alert, remote immobilization, geofencing, time fencing, remote door lock/unlock, remote cooling, remote vehicle diagnostics, trip analytics etc.:  \\r\\nThe button next to the foglamp switch is to lock the charger (to prevent theft). Say you are charging the car overnight in the parking lot, pressing the button locks/unlocks the charger from the port:  \\r\\nThe rotary gear shifter has 4 modes - R, N, D & S. We wish there was a \"P\" (park) mode that would lock the car in place. There is a gap between the desired gear being selected and the drive mode actually being engaged. This will get to you while executing three-point turns:  \\r\\nA look at the rear bench seat with the new upholstery:  \\r\\nWith the front seat adjusted to my height of 5\\'10\", I had just about enough legroom. The recline angle is comfortable and the under-thigh support is satisfactory. There are more spacious competitors though:  \\r\\nThe 316-litre boot. Spare tyre chews away space. This is without the charging cable in place:  \\r\\nNo cladding on the inside of the boot lid. The pre-facelift Tigor had it (reference image):  \\r\\nSpare is a full-size tyre (175/65 R14) on a steel wheel:  \\r\\nLift up the boot floor and you will see the top of the battery pack: ', \"We visited the Tata Power charging station at the Tata dealership in Nerul, Navi Mumbai. There were CCS + CHA charging ports. The CHA type charging port was used for the previous Tigor EV. The current generation of EVs (Nexon & Tigor) use the CCS type 2 charger:  \\r\\nHere\\x92s a look at the plug for the CCS type 2 DC fast charger:  \\r\\nTo charge the Tigor EV, you\\x92ll have to install the Tata EZ Charge app. The app displays all the charging stations close to you. When you tap on a particular station, it will show the type of charging ports available at the station. Once you have selected the station, you can choose the type of charging \\x96 amount, units of charge, time for a charge & percentage of the charge. The app will then show the amount you have to pay. You can plug in the charger and wait. The overall process is quite easy and even a first-time user won\\x92t have any issues navigating through the app:   \\r\\nThe 25 kW DC fast charger at a Tata Power unit takes ~65 minutes to charge the battery from 0-80%. At a Tata Power unit, a unit of charge (kWh) costs Rs. 18. Some third-party charging stations charge up to Rs. 20 for the same. That's far more expensive than charging at home. The unit displays how much time is left according to your selection of units:  \\r\\nA blue indicator light comes on when you plug in the charger, and a green indicator starts glowing when the charging begins:  \\r\\nThe 15A charger that you get with the car takes ~8 hours and 45 minutes to charge the batteries from 0-80%. Best to charge it overnight (at home) or when parked at the office (during the day): \", 'The Tigor EV was better than I expected. The on-paper stats had me believe that it will be underpowered, but that\\'s not the case. While the drive in D is ordinary (it\\'s more like ECO mode or a 1.2L NA petrol), \"S\" was sufficiently peppy. I had a good long drive on the highway. \"D\" should easily give you about 200 km range which is sufficient for a city commuter, but with a heavy foot in \"S\" mode, I took the range down from 228 -> 80 km after driving ~110 km.  \\nI\\'m very proud that Tata has snatched the first-mover advantage away from Mahindra, and is selling this world-class technology at attainable prices while Maruti sells 20-year old 4-speed AT gearboxes, Honda still keeps harping about its \"Yo Vtec\" technology from the 1990s and VW-Skoda couldn\\'t even make their 1.5L Diesel BS6 compliant. In the midst of these outdated / lazy approaches comes Tata offering cutting-edge tech .  \\nThere is a certain sense of pride driving a green number-plate car & other road users do respect you. No denying the camaraderie among EV owners either. Came across this Nexon EV and all of its occupants excitedly waved at me as if I\\'m a long lost cousin.

Do we know if the battery is water cooled? The more ideal the temperature of the battery pack, the better it is for long term. As it stands, the long term battery degradation is still an unknown for Tata. Was the range with A/C on? And if it was, what was it with the A/C off, if checked?', 'I think this is a desperate attempt to flog a dead car and in meantime, grab eyeballs and attention while the actually relevant Altroz EV gets ready. Tigor wasn’t anyone’s favourite child to begin with. And nobody is going to touch a Tata car which Tata itself sells as a taxi. The product may be decent in isolation but it’s a Tigor at the end of the day. A 7-8 lakh rupee car priced in the WagonR-Swift-Ignis range. Who is going to buy a Tigor for 13L?', \"What a wonderful review. Rating it five stars.  \\nExcellent to see Tata make such a fast move (compared to their peers) in the EV space. Tells a lot of their focus and how they are definitely trying to have the first mover advantage before Tesla (and probably the rest of the global players following them) drops in India to take the premium EV section. Which probably will be a lot of the initial customer base of Tata EV cars. \\n------------------------------------ \\nAs for the review, request a few more areas to be considered wrt to such EV reviews if possible. I can think of a few below - probably other potential buyers could chip in further \\n- a current view on the charging network. Would be extremely useful to folks like me who are and will be on the fence for the next few years to understand how the manufacturer based and 3rd party charging infrastructure is developing  \\n- Potential niggles and worries wrt to EV wear & tear. Those exposed wiring (especially under the car) feel a bit more dangerous wrt to external elements - say rat biting. What would be the potential scenarios of such cases - just a non-working car or even more damage/risk? Does the EV car warranty cover such scenarios given we no longer have a ICE engine under the hood now?  \\n- Any views on additional insurance cover. ICE cars would have engine cover (or similar terminology) to provide additional cover to what's under the hood.

With this launch, Tata is just stamping their image as market leaders in EV segment, in the minds of the customers. \\r\\nWith Nexon, Tigor and Altroz done, I foresee that the Harrier will be next car to get the EV Treatment. Safari will most probably not get it as a limited range EV really doesnt resonate with the explorer nature / positioning of Safari. \\r\\nGo Tata!  \\r\\nAlso, anyone has the on-road pricing list for different states? This subsidy thing is really difficult to grasp currently (due to lack of awareness).', 'Excellent review covering all the details. Tigor EV does not makes much of a sense as Nexon EV is sitting just a couple of lakhs away with a perceived better range. Also what Tata could have done is priced Tigor at starting 9L which could have translated it into an affordable option compared to Nexon. But kudos to Tata for atleast giving decent offerings in electric range as well. \\r\\nI wonder where they would pitch in the Altroz EV if Tigor is priced at 11.99L. There are also rumours of Altroz getting more range than even Nexon.', \"Good. Feels like a trailer for better things to come! \\nAltroz will be real deal. Hope they stick in same powerplant as Nexon in it and don't treat it step-motherly. Also great move by Tata.

Hydrogen fuel cell cars are also gaining traction globally and we might see them here too in the times to come. Technology adoption has become the name of the game and those who won't play by the rules would slowly but surely perish. \\r\\nHowever, India is a highly price sensitive market and the 'Kitna Deti Hai' factor is a big contributor to purchasing decisions. So I just did a high level calculation of whether it would make financial sense to go for a car like the new Tigor EV over a similar ICE model and if it does, how much does the owner really stand to benefit over the lifecycle of the vehicle taken to be 15 years here, with an average running of 1500 kms a month.   \\r\\nThese are just ballpark figures but it can be clearly deduced that EVs save in a good amount of money overall. Adding cherry to the cake are the government subsidies and the additional income tax benefits which I haven't even accounted for in these calculations. \\r\\nFor someone requiring a car only for city commutes, EVs make a lot of sense. They are zippy, fun to drive, and save a lot of money while being so. Charge them at home overnight and you are good to go the next day or maybe even two days. They have their limitations as of now but the benefits definitely far exceed those limitations. \\r\\nPeople using a car for regular/ frequent long highway runs and people living in areas facing long and frequent power cuts should wait for some more time before the public charging infrastructure adequately covers major parts of the country and the cost of using such infrastructure also comes down. \\r\\nTo sum it up, we are headed in the right direction; an ecosystem where power is generated utilising an optimum mix of renewable and non-renewable sources and consumption is reduced through use of highly energy efficient products and services.\", \"Tata deserves all the praise for bringing out 'usable' EVs to the masses.

I am not sure how many of us have that kind of running and in this case we are talking about an EV with a rather limited real world range!

It's been delayed as we hardly use the car as of now, due to CoViD. But now I need to take a decision, and I have considered the following three offerings - MG ZS EV Excite, Nexon EV XZ+ & now the Tigor EV XZ+. I loved the MG ZS EV by the way, it felt like a perfect electric car! But after giving it a lot of thought, I may pick the Tigor EV, and here are my reasons - \\r\\n1) ICE vs BEV: For me, cost of ownership comparisons with ICE cars does not make sense (it's not always numbers!). I am in the market only for EVs, we need to switch as soon as possible ... \\r\\n2) Cost & Tech: I totally agree that EVs are still maturing, and I didn't want to put in a lot of money and end up with outdated technology in a very short span of 3 years. So this makes me hesitant towards picking the ZS EV \\r\\n3) Performance: Considering my current car, performance in Tigor EV seems just enough for me, going by the reviews. So, I won't miss the Nexon EV in this aspect \\r\\n4) Range: I will mostly use it in the city, with weekend drives to places under 80 km - a total drive of 150 km to 180 km.\\r\\nRange wise ZS EV is far ahead, but again you pay for it accordingly. Between Nexon & Tigor, looks like Nexon isn't giving a lot more (considering the 3 lakh+ additional on-road price for XZ+ including insurance) - please correct me, if you think Nexon gives us considerably more range. \\r\\n5) Safety: Here Nexon seems better, but again Tigor EV was at least crash tested (unlike Nexon EV), and it's probably ok to go with a 4 Star rated car (for child passengers with restraint, Nexon scores 3 stars, while Tigor gets 4 stars). I would be more confident though, if it was tested from the rear too, considering the battery is on the rear. \\r\\nSo, putting in 3 lakh less than Nexon EV, I get range close to it, with performance and tech that I find satisfactory - so Tigor EV it is!! And I hope I can make this my second car in 3 years or so when higher range batteries and technology become more affordable.\", 'I feel the Altroz would have been a better candidate for \\'EV conversion\\' - a well liked car like the Nexon.

Further where electricity is in short supply in most parts (witness DG sets and consequent pollution by them all over) should it not be used for its core purposes rather than mobility. What is the use to run DG set to produce electricity to charge an EV. \\n We have not even got around to proper recycling of lead acid batteries yet - lead is now ingrained almost everywhere in India. How will we treat toxic components of these new batteries - lithium, cadmium, polymers, etc. A lot of regulations over this must be brought in. \\nLast I checked Mumbai domestic electricity rates are way above Rs. 8/unit. 8.77+1.44+0.26. Add another 16% as duty on the whole. Comes to around 12-13/unit. Add 10-15% charging efficiency loss will actually be around Rs 15/unit. This is without FAC charges. These are a lot lower currently than in the past. That is why TATA fast charging costs Rs. 18-20/unit. It is actually just at cost. In some countries now EV running costs are actually higher than normal ICE car. That being said a lot of states offer lower rates for EVs so it is not easy to generalise. \\nAnother aspect is low running - whether charge/re-charge cycles or time - just like tires/oil, batteries also deteriorate over time whether you use or not. \\nAnother macro aspect is the economy.

With the atleast 2,50,000 INR incentives by states and a flat 1,50,000 INR tax rebate by Income Tax, the price comes down to 9 Lacs for the top end variant, which is a deal breaker, specially in cities wherein you have heavy traffic, your left foot needs rest, petrol is 100+ and you have the option to charge your car in the office/home campus.

So we would need 2 cars in the houshold. Then we were planning to get rid of the 4 year old Maruti Swift with almost 70,000 km on the odo and buy a new car. My mother was sure she wanted a bigger car and really liked the C-SUVs. Thus started my search for 2 cars to be bought, without creating too big a hole in the pocket both in terms of the cost of the cars as well as the regular running costs. \\r\\nWe ended up buying the Nexon Petrol XZ+ in December 2020 (took 4 months for delivery as we bought it via the GoI portal as my mom works in a PSU). This was a manual and both my mom and then gf clamoured that the other car should be an automatic. Within a month of driving the Nexon, I realised that this is not anywhere near efficient as the Swift which returned 13-14kmpl in the city and 16-18kmpl in the highway!  The Nexon was returning about 8-9kmpl in the city (especially in the hands of our driver) and about 14kmpl on the highway. \\r\\nHere is the Nexon during our Mumbai to Kanyakumari drive.    \\r\\nWe figured out a budget of about 6-7Lakhs for the second car. Considering my fuel bill from the Nexon, Petrol was a no go. Diesel Automatics in the new car segment were all going way beyond my budget. So looked at the used car market. I checked out some 15 cars from Cars24, Olx, Facebook Marketplace etc., however, none were either fitting the bill or would help with the lowering of the running costs which we hoped for. This made me look at EVs as an alternative, considering they would also comply with the demand for an automatic car and are usually frugal to run. I checked some less run (<15000 km on the odo) E2Os and E2O+. None were in a good shape and the prices being quoted seemed very high. Then, while going through Facebook Marketplace and OLX, I ended up contacting some folks in Nashik, who had bought some 20 eVeritos in auction from Mahindra itself. I bargained to buy an eVerito for 4.8L from the guy. We bought the car in March\\'21. This car had 120km of range and was just about adequate for the city drives.\\r\\nHere is the Mahindra eVerito. Yes I had added some stickers to make it look less like a white taxi.   \\r\\nWe used the car for about 11 months and covered 12,000kms on it. In that time I was convinced that an EV was perfect as a second car in the family, especially for city usage.  \\r\\nWith the Nexon EV gaining in popularity, Tata Power went on a war footing to set up EV chargers everywhere and even smaller companies like Statiq, etc were setting up chargers. BUT, they were all CCS2 type chargers and the eVerito, being a 72V system could only accept GBT type charger for fast charging. This made the eVerito obsolete. The eVerito did its part to convince me completely to buy an EV next time I bought a car, especially as a second car in the house. \\r\\nIn August\\'21 when Tata launched the Tigor, I was smitten by it. My best friend in Kolkata had a Tiago and I had driven it enough to know that for a city car it was more than adequate. The Tigor was the same chassis with the added boot space. \\r\\nI went to get a test drive for the Tigor the very next day, however, none of the Tata showrooms in Mumbai had a Tigor test drive vehicle (they said that all the test drive vehicles were on media drive duties after launch for 1 week)\\r\\nSo I ended up test driving the Nexon EV. And boy was I impressed! It was way better than the eVerito which I was driving and felt like a different class! On checking the prices, I realised that even post the subsidies being offered, I would need to shell out close to 15L. This was an absolute no go! Not to be disheartened, I booked myself for a test drive at the Puneet showroom in Prabhadevi (where I knew the folks considering they had delivered my Nexon) for the next week when the tigor would be available.  \\r\\nThe test drive car had about 1300km on the odo. I loved the experience. It had all the ingredients of the Nexon EV, but in a smaller package. All 3 of us took turns to test drive the car and even though we were not looking to buy a car, were quite convinced that we should replace the eVerito with the Tigor EV!  \\r\\nIn the meantime, Maharashtra Government announced the EV subsidy scheme and the early bird scheme. We calculated that if we bought the Tigor before end of December\\'21, we would end up with 2.3L as a subsidy. This along with the fact that we were getting almost 4.5L for the eVerito (this is the time when the cost of petrol hit 100 for the first time and people were looking for EVs), convinced us that we should sell the eVerito and buy the Tigor EV. \\r\\nExperience of Ownership- \\r\\nWe took delivery of the car on 3rd February 2022. It costed us exactly 11Lon road post all the subsidies and dealer level discounts.   \\r\\nThe same week we took delivery of the Tigor, we decided to do a trip to Alibaug. This was the first time I was taking an EV outside Mumbai, so I decided to completely plan the trip. I made a note of all the charging stations along the way (there were none post Navi Mumbai) and even kept a note of the Tata dealer nearest from Alibaug in case I needed help in terms of getting towed if I got stuck without charge somewhere. The distance to the resort from my place in Mumbai was showing 120km and I knew that if I drove in a sedate manner, I would be able to reach and come back to Navi Mumbai and charge somewhere. Thankfully we were able to charge at the resort itself. Thus began the Tigor EV journey for my family. \\r\\nSo, the Tigor EV will deliver about 180-220km of range no matter how you drive (unless you decide to thrash it around in Sports mode) in the city or on the highway. It takes 7-8hrs to charge via a 15amps socket. Mostly we drive the Tigor in the city and a once a month trip to Pune which come to about 400km( 300km to and fro and some running within Pune). \\r\\nJust to put into context the cost savings one can get from an EV- a round trip to Pune costs us about INR1100 (INR 630 tolls and about INR450-500 for charging the car on slow charger at both Mumbai and Pune overnight). In the Nexon petrol it would cost us something like INR 3800-4000 (considering 14kmpl average, 30liters of Petrol and rest 630 toll). Thats like 1/3rd the cost if not lesser. When compared to my Nexon, its like saving INR10 for every km I drive the Tigor EV vis a vis my Nexon. This has meant that the Nexon is only used when we end up going for our once in a quarter long drive. \\r\\nIn my 8 months and about 12,000km experience of the Tigor EV, here are the positives- \\r\\n1. The drive on the Tigor is silent, plaint and comfortable.\\r\\n2. The Harman sourced music system is very good in terms of the music quality, barely average in terms of the touch screen. \\r\\n3. No issues in going through the \"roads\" of Mumbai post monsoon. Suspension is quite sorted, supple.\\r\\n4. Power delivery is just as it should be on an EV- Instant. To put it into perspective, the 74bhp is not a lot, but the car can easily be driven at 90kmph on the expressway and it feels extremely stable. The torque is brilliant and the traffic light \"its lights off and away we go\" race sessions are quite enjoyable.\\r\\n5. In my humble opinion, you get 2 cars in the Tigor EV- one sedate and well mannered one when the car is in D mode and another crazy unexpected car when in S mode. They feel like poles apart. I tried to drive the car in an enthusiastic manner in S mode for a full day, it lasted me 89km and the battery was at 22%. So if you want to extract range, you need to be sedate\\r\\n6. Sound isolation in the Tigor EV is average, however you will feel a certain calm in it, even in the hustle and bustle of city life\\r\\n7. The car delivers 200km of range in most use cases within the city, which with an average commute of 30km/day would last a whole week before one needs to recharge \\r\\nHeres the photo of the odo when I completed 10,000kms!     \\r\\nIn the last 8 months, I have observed the following in terms of issues- \\r\\n1. Do not believe the range shown on the console. It completely depends on how you have driven in the last 15mins/ 5kms. Look at the below image, its next to impossible that a car with 26kWh battery gives that much range with ~70% battery remaining. One should instead look at the wh/km reading and try and keep that below 120 and you are good to go. Better caliberation should be done in the range displayed.    \\r\\n2. The Air condition system on the Tigor EV is faulty. It just never works when you need it to. Its not just my experience. I am a part of a group of more than 200 Tigor EV owners from all over India and almost 70% of us have faced some or the other issue with the AC. In my case, it worked perfectly till the 2nd free service at 7000km, since then the AC stops working if the ambient temperature goes above 30-32C and when you need it the most. Even when the AC works, its absolutely not adequate.  \\r\\n3. Fit and Finish issues- There are rattles from B and C pillars which start appearing every time one goes through a pothole riddled road. Being an EV, these rattles are even more prominent and irksome. The only way to solve this is to open up the internal panels and shut them up tight with a few hits. \\r\\n4. The Tigor EV cannot be fast charged at all types of Fast chargers, even those on the Tata Power EZ charge app. This is a major concern as one might have planned to juice up at a particular charger and the car wont accept the charge. I believe this can be rectified via some software updates. \\r\\n5. The Z connect App which Tata provides often times does not work or even if it works, shows wrong information. Also, it beats me as to how a company which has a tech giant like TCS as a sister company can have such glitches-     \\r\\n6. The absence of different modes of regeneration and Cruise control are a big miss in the Tigor EV. EVs like ICE cars work most efficiently when driven at a constant speed. Efficiency is even more critical in an EV as it may mean the difference of 2-3km can decide whether you could reach your destination or got stranded midway. Hopefully Tata will provide these with an update like that in the case of the Nexon EV users.  \\r\\nOverall, I am extremely happy with the car as is my family. Its a very good car for the city. The Tigor EV is comfortable, well spec\\'ed and delivers a decent range for daily city usage and planned highway usage.     ', 'Thank you for a well detailed review. I am seriously considering buying an EV, reviews like these are most useful. I have a few followup questions for you, would be great if you can answer them.
